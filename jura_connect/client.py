"""TCP client for the Jura WiFi protocol (unset-PIN flow supported).

Layers:

* :class:`JuraConnection` -- raw framed transport (write/read encoded frames).
* :class:`JuraClient`     -- handshake (`@HP:`) + structured read operations.

Wire framing and crypto live in :mod:`jura_connect.protocol` / :mod:`jura_connect.crypto`
and are shared with the in-tree :mod:`jura_connect.simulator`.

Handshake (matches the J.O.E. Android app's ``WifiCommandConnectionSetup``)::

    -> @HP:<pin>,<conn_id_hex>,<auth_hash>\\r\\n
    <- @hp4                  CORRECT, no new hash
       @hp4:<hash>           CORRECT, persist ``<hash>`` for next time
       @hp5 / @hp5:00        WRONG_PIN  -- machine wants a PIN, none given
       @hp5:01               WRONG_HASH -- conn-id unknown / hash stale
       @hp5:02               ABORTED    -- machine refused

Initial pairing on a machine without a PIN configured:

1. The client opens a TCP session and sends ``@HP:,<conn_id_hex>,``
   (both ``pin`` and ``auth_hash`` empty).
2. The coffee machine pops up a **Connect** dialog on its own display.
3. The user accepts on the machine.
4. The machine replies with ``@hp4:<hash>`` carrying a 64-hex-char auth
   token, which the client surfaces via ``HandshakeResult.new_hash``.

The caller persists ``new_hash`` and passes it as ``auth_hash`` on
subsequent runs to skip the on-machine confirmation.

        Skipping the lock/unlock wrapper is the bug v0.9.0 - v0.9.1
        shipped: the dongle ACKs the bare ``@TM:`` write with
        ``@tm:<arg>`` so the call looks successful, but the machine
        silently ignores the new value until a future power cycle.
        The APK ALWAYS wraps PMODE-priority commands; we now do the
        same.

        The checksum follows the J.O.E. APK's ``ByteOperations.d``:
        sum every ASCII byte of ``"<arg>,<value>"``, cast
        ``-1 - sum`` to a signed byte, format as two upper-case hex
        chars and append.

        When :attr:`profile` is set and carries a
        :class:`~jura_connect.profile.SettingDef` for ``p_argument``,
        ``value_hex`` is run through
        :meth:`~jura_connect.profile.SettingDef.normalise_value`
        first. That accepts an ITEM name (``"30min"``), a raw catalogue
        hex value (``"211E"``), or — for step sliders — a decimal
        integer in range; any other input raises :class:`ValueError`
        before the dongle ever sees it. This guards against writing
        e.g. ``auto_off = "30"`` (which would mean raw byte ``0x30 =
        48 dec`` rather than the ``30min`` ItemSlider entry ``"211E"``).
        When no profile is loaded, the value is passed through
        unchanged.

        When ``verify`` is true (default), reads the setting back
        AFTER the unlock and raises :class:`ValueError` if the
        stored value doesn't match — guards against a firmware that
        accepts the wrapped write but still silently drops it.
        Disable via ``verify=False`` if the read-back path is broken

        **APK-derived request, guessed reply layout, never answered by

        XML and then throws it away (``Bank``'s constructor drops it),
        and its WiFi settings path is ``WifiCommandReadPModeComposite``
        — one ``@TM:<arg>`` per setting. So nothing in the app tells us
        what the machine answers here. What we send is the XML's
        ``Command`` verbatim, like every other ``<BANK Command="…">``;
        what we expect back is modelled on the single-setting read:

            client → @TM:00,FC
            dongle → @tm:00,<v1><v2>…<checksum>
            dongle → @tm:00                  (rejection — no bank)

        with the values concatenated in ``CommandArgument`` order and
        self-delimited by the ItemSlider type tags documented in
        §5.7 (``21`` = one value byte follows, ``22`` = two, anything
        else = a bare one-byte value), and ``<checksum>`` the usual
        ``ByteOperations.d`` over ``"00,<values>"``.

        Pass ``checksum=True`` to append the ``ByteOperations.d``
        checksum to the *request* as well (``@TM:00,FCEA``) — the other
        plausible request form, since ``@TM:60,…`` and every settings
        write carry one while ``@TM:41/42,…`` reads do not. Which form
        (if either) a real machine accepts is unknown — and on the one
        machine asked so far it cannot matter: an S8 EB / EF1091
        answered ``@tm:80`` to ``@TM:00,FC`` *and* to the bare
        ``@TM:00``, i.e. address ``00`` is not implemented at all, so no

        **Destructive**: the machine immediately heats up, grinds, and
        dispenses at the spout. Make sure a suitable cup is in place;
        there is no remote abort.

        ``product`` is resolved via :meth:`resolve_product` (pass
        ``substring=True`` to widen name matching). Recipe parameters
        use XML units — ``ml`` for water, brew ``strength`` level,
        ``temperature`` as ITEM name (``"low"`` / ``"normal"`` /
        ``"high"``) or value, ``milk_foam`` / ``milk_break`` in seconds,
        ``bypass`` in ml, and ``grinder_ratio`` as an ITEM name
        (``"100_0"`` … ``"0_100"`` on EF566) or value. Anything left
        ``None`` falls back to the XML default for this product. Values
        are validated against the machine XML before going on the wire.

        **Not live-verified — may misbrew, verify on your hardware:**
        ``bypass``, ``milk_foam`` and ``milk_break`` are encoded from
        the XML (ml ÷5 ticks, seconds as-is) but not confirmed on a
        physical machine. Water and temperature are live-verified.

        The wire format is a 16-byte blob (verified live on an E8 (EB)
        / EF538): byte 0 is the product code; each XML parameter lands
        on byte ``F-1``. A bare product code — what the Bluetooth-era
        docs suggest — is ACK'd with ``@tp`` but silently ignored by
        TT237W-family WiFi firmware, and an unset water byte means 255
        ticks ≈ 1.3 l, so always send the full validated blob.

        ``preselections`` names the extra-shot / double / powder /
        cold-brew / light-brew / sweet-foam toggles to apply, validated
        against what the product's ``<PRESELECTION>`` element declares
        and against the machine's legal ``<COMBINATION>`` rows. On an
        old-T-protocol machine (the S8 EB among them) a ``double``
        **selects a different product** — the recipe is then built from
        that double product, whose parameters may differ. See
        :meth:`~jura_connect.profile.MachineProfile.plan_preselections`
        for what each machine generation can express;
        ``preselect_mask`` forces the mask byte of an ``IntakeF18``
        machine verbatim. **Preselection encoding is APK-derived and has
        never been seen on a wire — it may misbrew** (PROTOCOL.md
        §5.13).

        ``retry=True`` sends the blob a second time if the first reply
        is not an ``@tp`` accept: a machine in ``energy_safe`` wakes on
        the first ``@TP:`` but may ignore it (see PROTOCOL.md §5.9).

        Returns the dongle's reply (``"@tp"`` on accept), matched with
        :data:`BREW_REPLY_MATCH` so that a pushed ``@TB`` / ``@TS``
        marker can never be read as the acknowledgement. The machine
        emits ``@TB`` (brew start) and ``@TV:`` progress frames right
        after, observable via :meth:`iter_frames` /
        :meth:`iter_progress`.

        ``follow=True`` (off by default, so the call stays a single
        round-trip unless asked) blocks after an accepted blob and
        collects the progress stream via :meth:`follow_progress` until
        the ``ENJOY`` frame or ``follow_timeout`` seconds. The frames
        land in :attr:`last_progress`; ``on_progress`` sees each one as
        it arrives. A rejected blob (``@tp:00``) is never followed —
        the machine sends nothing to follow.
