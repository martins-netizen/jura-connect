"""Per-machine profile loader (alerts, products, pmode capabilities).

The J.O.E. Android APK ships 88 XML files under
``apk/assets/documents/xml/<EF_code>/<version>.xml`` describing each
machine variant: which alert bits exist, which product codes the
machine knows, whether pmode slots are configurable, etc. The codes
differ meaningfully across machines — e.g. on the EF536 (legacy S8)
``0x12`` is "2 Espressi" but on the EF1091 (S8 EB) "2 Espressi"
lives at ``0x31``. Hard-coding any single map is wrong.

This module loads the XMLs lazily, parses the relevant sections
(``ALERTS``, ``PRODUCTS``, ``MACHINESETTINGS``) into a
:class:`MachineProfile`, and offers lookup helpers — including a
mapping from a machine's article-number (read from the discovery
reply) to the matching EF code via the bundled ``JOE_MACHINES.TXT``.

Profiles are cached in-process after first load. The loader uses
:mod:`importlib.resources` so it works inside a wheel, in a Nix
store path, or against a local checkout without any path tricks.

        silently does nothing (no ``@TB`` / ``@TV`` frames, counters

        ``overrides`` maps parameter kinds to values in XML units,
        e.g. ``{"water_amount": 220, "temperature": "high"}``. Use the
        ``KIND_*`` constants for the keys. Parameters not overridden
        fall back to the XML default. Values are validated against the
        XML catalogue *before* anything goes on the wire.

        **Not live-verified — may misbrew, verify on your hardware:**
        the ``milk_break`` encoding is inferred from the XML (seconds,
        sent as-is), not individually confirmed. Water, temperature,
        strength and bypass are live-verified on the S8 EB;

        Z10 (EA) / EF545 (Milkcoffee blob
        ``05000812030202000100000000000000`` — milk 3 s, foam 2 s —
        brewed with the physical pour matching both phases).

        Raises :class:`ValueError` on unknown override kinds, on
        out-of-range values, and when a millilitre parameter the product
        *has* would be left unset (no override and no XML default):
        with 00-padding that byte would be ``0x00`` = **no water**, so
        rather than silently brew a dry/short shot this is refused —
        pass an explicit amount.

        ``preselect_mask`` / ``preselect_bytes`` carry preselections and

        * a 17-byte array pre-filled with ``0x00``;
        * byte ``F-1`` for every ``Argument="F<n>"`` parameter, using

        Two deliberate differences from :meth:`build_recipe_hex`:

        * the blob is 17 bytes, not 16 — ``F17`` (grinder freeness)
          needs byte 16, and ``AppProduct.d()`` always allocates it;
        * byte 8 is **not** forced to ``0x01``. That "recipe valid"
          byte belongs to the ``@TP:`` start command (``AppProduct.c()``
          sets it after calling ``d()``); the PMode write sends the
          raw parameter blob.

        ``overrides`` works exactly as for :meth:`build_recipe_hex`.

        (``AppProduct.c``), and so does this method:

        * **Old T-protocol** (no ``<MACHINEMANIFEST>``; the maintainer's
          S8 EB / EF1091 is one). A ``double`` is a *different product*:
          the XML's ``<PRESELECTION double="31"/>`` names its code, so
          the plan swaps :attr:`~PreselectionPlan.product` for that
          catalogue entry — consistent with §5.5 of PROTOCOL.md, where
          the S8 EB counts its doubles at the separate slots ``0x31`` /
          ``0x36``. ``powder``, ``coldbrew``, ``lightbrew`` and
          ``xtrashot`` overwrite one recipe byte each
          (:data:`PRESELECT_LEGACY_BYTES`). Everything else —
          ``sweetfoam``, ``fakesweetfoam``, ``strongcoldbrew`` — has no
          wire representation at all: J.O.E. offers those toggles on
          such machines and then sends nothing for them, so they are
          refused here rather than silently dropped.
        * **New protocol** (``IntakeF18="true"``). Nothing is
          overwritten and no product swap happens; every preselection is
          one bit of a **mask byte appended to the blob**
          (:data:`PRESELECT_MASK_BITS`, offset
          :data:`PRESELECT_MASK_OFFSET`). ``double`` is bit ``0x40``
          there, not a product code.

        Note that a ``double`` product is usually marked
        ``Active="false"`` in the XML (it is not a menu entry), and that
        it carries its *own* recipe parameters — often none at all — so
        overrides valid for the single product may not be valid for its
        double.

        ``mask`` overrides the computed mask byte verbatim (an escape
        hatch for firmware that numbers the bits differently); it is
        only meaningful on an ``IntakeF18`` machine.

        **None of the encoding is hardware-verified.** It is transcribed
        from the APK — see PROTOCOL.md §5.13, and check a real machine
        before trusting it. Raises :class:`ValueError` on every
