# Jura WiFi protocol — technical reference

Source-of-truth document for the implementation. Captures every detail
that was extracted from the J.O.E. Android APK (`ch.toptronic.joe`
v4.6.10) and validated against a real coffee machine (Jura S8 EB,
firmware `TT237W V06.11`, hostname `espressif.lan`, MAC prefix
`0c:8b:95` = Espressif Inc.).

Numbers, byte values and command codes here are *observed* values, not
guesses — if a behaviour differs from this doc, fix the doc.

Raw wire traces from hardware runs live in [`captures/`](captures/),
one file per session. Claims below that cite a capture are backed by a
verbatim frame log; claims marked *APK-derived* or *untested* are not.
The EF566 grinder-ratio verification was a physical end-to-end
observation without a raw trace and is documented separately in
[`EF566_GRINDER_RATIO.md`](EF566_GRINDER_RATIO.md).

## 1. Transport

| Layer | Port  | Protocol | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Discovery — broadcast  | 51515 | UDP | 16-byte scan probe, dongle replies via broadcast on same port |
| Discovery — unicast    | 51515 | UDP | Probe targeted at one IP; **TT237W ignores unicast** (broadcast-only) |
| Status / commands      | 51515 | TCP | Single long-lived session; one client at a time |

Both UDP and TCP services share the same port. On the TT237W firmware the
dongle does **not** reply to UDP scans at all — the client falls back to
a TCP-port-51515 sweep across the local /24s to locate machines.

### 1.1 TCP frame

Each frame is exactly:

```
b'*'   <encoded_body>   b'\r\n'
```

* `b'*'` (0x2A) is the sync byte that begins every frame.
* `<encoded_body>` starts with the *key byte* used to encode the rest of
  the body, followed by the obfuscated payload (see §2).
* `b'\r\n'` (0x0D 0x0A) terminates the frame.

A `recv` parser should:

1. Drop everything in the buffer up to (but not including) the next `*`.
2. Read until the next un-escaped `\r\n`.
3. Decrypt with the recovered key.

**Inner CRLF (verified against the J.O.E. Android app on TT237W).**
The *cleartext* body — the ASCII command string before the cipher runs
— also ends with a literal `\r\n`. So the bytes the dongle decodes
look like e.g. `@TM:13,211E96\r\n`, not `@TM:13,211E96`. This inner
CRLF is in addition to the outer frame terminator above. Discovered
the hard way: TT237W (Jura S8 EB) silently rejects settings writes
whose body has no inner CRLF, replying `@tm:00` for any
`@TM:<arg>,<val><csum>`. Reads happen to work without it, which made
the asymmetry hard to spot. `jura_connect.protocol.wrap` always
appends the inner CRLF on send (idempotent) and
`jura_connect.protocol.unwrap` / `FrameReader.next_frame` strip it on
receive so callers see clean payloads. Empirically every J.O.E.
phone→dongle and dongle→phone frame in the pcap carries the inner
CRLF, so this appears to be a general protocol rule, not a TT237W
quirk.

### 1.2 Reserved byte set

Five byte values trigger the escape mechanism inside the encoded body:

```
RESERVED = { 0x00, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x1B, 0x26 }
```

Any byte that would otherwise sit in `<encoded_body>` and equals one of
these values is emitted as the two-byte sequence `0x1B <byte^0x80>`.
This also applies to the leading key byte itself. On receive, the
escape is undone before the cipher is run.

Note: the leading sync `0x2A` (`*`) is **not** in the reserved set —
once the decoder has past the sync byte it never expects another `*`.

---

## 2. Obfuscation cipher (`WifiCryptoUtil`)

A self-inverse, per-nibble permutation. The exact same routine encrypts
and decrypts; client and simulator both call into
`jura_connect.crypto.encode_payload` and `decode_payload`.

### 2.1 S-boxes

```
SBOX_A = (1, 0, 3, 2, 15, 14, 8, 10, 6, 13, 7, 12, 11, 9, 5, 4)
SBOX_B = (9, 12, 6, 11, 10, 15, 2, 14, 13, 0, 4, 3, 1, 8, 7, 5)
```

### 2.2 Key

For every outgoing frame the client picks a random key byte. Keys
whose low nibble is `0x0E` or `0x0F` are rejected (the J.O.E. app loops
until it gets a valid one); presumably those values would collide with
something else in firmware.

### 2.3 Per-nibble permutation

```
def _a(nibble, pos, key_hi, key_full):
    iB = (nibble + pos + key_hi) % 16
    i11 = pos >> 4
    inner = ((i11 + SBOX_A[iB] + key_full) - pos - key_hi) % 16
    outer = ((SBOX_B[inner] + key_hi + pos - key_full) - i11) % 16
    return (SBOX_A[outer] - pos - key_hi) % 16
```

`pos` is a running nibble counter (starts at 0, increments by 1 per
nibble — i.e. by 2 per byte). For a 100-byte payload `pos` reaches 200.

The function is its own inverse. Verified exhaustively in
`tests/test_crypto.py` for every valid key value plus 500 random
inputs.

### 2.4 Frame composition

```
write '*'
maybe-escape key, then write it
for each input byte b:
    eh = _a((b >> 4) & 0xF, pos,   key_hi, key_full)
    el = _a(b & 0xF,        pos+1, key_hi, key_full)
    enc = (eh << 4) | el
    maybe-escape enc
    pos += 2
write '\r\n'
```

Decoding reverses only the escape handling; the inner `_a` call is the
same.

---

## 3. Discovery

### 3.1 Scan probe

```
0x00 0x10 0xA5 0xF3   0x00 * 12
```

A static 16-byte UDP datagram, sent to the broadcast address of every
local /24. The reply (when one comes — only seen on older firmware than
TT237W) carries the structure below.

### 3.2 Reply layout

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| 0..2   |  2 | total length (big-endian) |
| 2..4   |  2 | control word: low 12 bits == 1523 (0x5F3); bit-15 set, bit-14 clear (per the APK's odd MSB-from-byte-0 numbering) |
| 4..20  | 16 | firmware version string, ASCII, space-padded (e.g. `TT237W V06.11`) |
| 20..52 | 32 | user-assigned machine name (e.g. `Kaffeebert`) |
| 52..68 | 16 | hardware identifier |
| 68..70 |  2 | article number (BE u16) |
| 70..72 |  2 | machine number (BE u16) |
| 72..74 |  2 | serial number (BE u16) |
| 74..76 |  2 | production date (`((year-1990)<<9) \| (month<<5) \| day`) |
| 76..78 |  2 | UCHI production date (same encoding) |
| 78..108| 30 | reserved / opaque |
| 108..109| 1 | extra byte |
| 109   |   1 | status flags: bit 0 = in-use, bit 4 = ready, bit 7 = standby |
| 110.. |  L | live alert bitfield (re-emitted as `@TF:<hex>` over TCP) |

### 3.3 Unusual bit indexing

The APK's `WifiFrog.G(idx, bArr)` function picks bit `(8*N - idx - 1) %
8` of byte `(8*N - idx - 1) // 8` for an N-byte array. For the 2-byte
control word this means `G(14)` reads bit 1 of the **high** byte (not
bit 14 of the word). Our parser mirrors this exactly; the unit test
`test_discovery.py::test_flag_helpers` covers it.

---

## 4. Handshake (`@HP:`)

### 4.1 Request

```
@HP:<pin>,<conn_id_hex>,<auth_hash>\r\n
```

* `pin` — ASCII PIN if the machine has one set; **empty** when none.
* `conn_id_hex` — `ExtensionsKt.c(SecurityManager.f40668d)` in the
  APK, which is just `''.join(f'{ord(c):02X}' for c in conn_id)`. The
  conn-id is *our* identifier (the J.O.E. app uses the device's
  Bluetooth name). It can be any ASCII string we choose.
* `auth_hash` — 64-hex-char token issued by the dongle on the **first
  successful pair**, or empty for an initial pair.

### 4.2 Responses

| Reply         | `ConnectionSetupState` | Meaning |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| `@hp4`        | CORRECT                | already paired, no fresh hash |
| `@hp4:<hash>` | CORRECT                | first-time pair: persist `<hash>` |
| `@hp5` / `@hp5:00` | WRONG_PIN         | PIN field wrong or required |
| `@hp5:01`     | WRONG_HASH             | conn-id unknown or hash stale |
| `@hp5:02`     | ABORTED                | conn-id known but hash mismatched / refused |

### 4.3 Unset-PIN pairing flow (verified against Kaffeebert)

1. **Client → dongle**: open TCP, send `@HP:,<conn_id_hex>,`
   (both pin and auth_hash empty).
2. **Dongle**: pops up a "Connect" dialog on its own touchscreen.
3. **User**: presses OK on the coffee machine.
4. **Dongle → client**: `@hp4:<64-hex-char-hash>`.
5. **Client**: persists `<hash>` (see §6) and treats the connection
   as authenticated.

On subsequent connections the client sends `@HP:,<conn_id_hex>,<hash>`
and gets back a bare `@hp4` (no on-machine confirmation needed).

The dialog timeout observed in practice is well under 60 s. The J.O.E.
app uses 40 s as its server-side timeout
(`WifiCommand.timeoutAfterSeconds = 40L`); the Python client uses
60 s by default for human comfort.

### 4.4 PIN pairing flow (machines with a setup PIN)

Machines that carry a front-panel setup PIN (e.g. Jura E6 / EF1030)
verify the PIN *before* showing the "Connect" dialog. The flow is
otherwise identical to §4.3, with the PIN filled into the first field:

1. **Client → dongle**: open TCP, send `@HP:<pin>,<conn_id_hex>,`
   (auth_hash empty, `<pin>` the ASCII digits).
2. **Dongle**: rejects with `@hp5` / `@hp5:00` (WRONG_PIN) if the PIN is
   missing or wrong; otherwise pops up the "Connect" dialog.
3. **User**: presses OK on the coffee machine.
4. **Dongle → client**: `@hp4:<64-hex-char-hash>`.
5. **Client**: persists both `<hash>` **and the PIN** (see §6) — the PIN
   is required again on every reconnect, so the client stores it and
   replays `@HP:<pin>,<conn_id_hex>,<hash>` each time.

CLI: pass `--pin <digits>` to `jura-connect pair`; it is written to the
credential store and reused automatically on later `jura-connect
command` runs. Pass `--pin` again only to override a stored PIN. The
PIN itself is never shown by `creds --json` (only `pin_stored: true`).

### 4.5 Failure modes seen in practice

* `@hp5:02 ABORTED` when reconnecting with an empty hash on a conn-id
  that was previously paired — the dongle remembers the slot and won't
  let it be silently re-claimed. **Solution**: pick a fresh `conn_id`
  and run the pair flow again (which trips the on-machine prompt).
* `@hp5:01 WRONG_HASH` when supplying a wrong hash for a known
  conn-id — same recovery: fresh `conn_id` + new pair.
* Empty hash with a *brand-new* conn-id that the dongle has never
  seen, but the dongle's display is asleep / not engaged: the dongle
  silently emits `@TF:` status frames without ever sending
  `@hp4`/`@hp5`. The Python client treats this as a `PairingTimeout`.
* `ConnectionResetError` mid-handshake when **reconnecting too soon
  after closing a session**. Observed on a Z10 (NAA, EF545): the TCP
  connection is accepted, the `@HP:` frame is written, and the dongle
  resets instead of answering. It is session churn the dongle objects
  to, not connections — a socket that connects and then sends nothing
  is held open indefinitely without a reset, and the same credentials
  that fail back-to-back succeed with `@hp4` once left alone. Leaving
  ~20s between sessions was reliable; retrying immediately was not,
  through several consecutive attempts. Worth ruling out before
  suspecting a stale pairing, since the symptom looks identical.

  This may be the same behaviour as the mid-read drops noted for
  `@TM:42` in §5.6 — both are the dongle tearing down a session it has
  decided it is done with, rather than answering.

## 5. Commands

### 5.1 Read-only commands (implemented)

| Send             | Reply prefix      | Decoded type | Notes |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `@HP:p,c,h`      | `@hp4` / `@hp5`   | `HandshakeResult` | authentication |
| _(empty frame)_  | _none_            | —            | close the session — what J.O.E.'s `WifiCommandCloseConnection` sends, and what `JuraClient.close()` sends |
| `@HE`            | `@he:ok`          | —            | **OTA end** (`WifiCommandOTAEnd`), not a close verb — see below |
| `@HU?`           | `@hu:<3 hex>` (e.g. `@hu:800`) | — | milk-cooler update status (`WifiCommandMilkCoolerUpdateStatus`) — **not** a status request; see below |
| `@TG:FF`         | `@tg:FF`          | str          | cancel the running product step (`WifiCommandCancelProductStep`) — the "abort this brew" verb |
| `@TG:43`         | `@tg:43<8..12 bytes hex>` | `MaintenanceCounters` | 4..6 × big-endian u16, XML-declared order — see §5.3 |
| `@TG:C0`         | `@tg:C0<2..3 bytes hex>` | `MaintenancePercent` | 1 byte per XML-declared field (`0xFF` = N/A) — see §5.3 |
| `@TS:01`         | `@TB` then `@ts`  | str | lock the front-panel display |
| `@TS:00`         | `@ts`             | str | unlock the display |
| `@TM:<addr>`     | `@tm:<addr>...`   | str | memory / setting read (firmware-specific) |
| `@TR:<bank>`     | `@tr:<bank>...`   | str | bank-register read |
| `@TR:32,<page>`  | `@tr:32,<page>,<8 bytes hex>` | `ProductCounters` (composite) | paginated brew counters — see §5.5 |
| `@TM:50`         | `@tm:50,<num_slots><checksum>` | `int`        | programmable-recipe slot count — see §5.6 |
| `@TM:42,<slot>`  | `@tm:42,<slot><product_code>…<checksum>` | `PModeSlot` | per-slot product code; `@tm:C2` = not supported on this machine — see §5.6 |
| `@TM:41,<code>`  | `@tm:41,<F1..Fn hex><checksum>` | `PModeProduct` | one product's stored PMode settings; `@tm:C1` = not supported — see §5.6 |

#### There is no "read status" command

`@HU?` was long assumed to be a status request because probes that sent
it usually saw a `@TF:` frame right after. The APK settles it: `@HU?` is
`WifiCommandMilkCoolerUpdateStatus` and its matcher is
`@hu:[0-9a-fA-F]{3}` — `@hu:800` *is* the answer to `@HU?`. The `@TF:`
that followed was just the dongle's next periodic broadcast arriving.

J.O.E. never polls for status at all: `TCPReceiveHandler` routes pushed
`@TF:` frames as they land. `JuraClient.read_status()` does the same —
it sends nothing and returns the next broadcast. `read_status(nudge=True)`
still emits `@HU?` first, as an escape hatch for firmwares that want
traffic on the socket, but the status always comes from the pushed
`@TF:` frame.

The same class of mislabel applies to `@HE`: it is `WifiCommandOTAEnd`
(expects `@he:ok`, part of a firmware-update session), not "polite
close". The app closes a session with an **empty frame** — a frame whose
cleartext body is just the inner CRLF. `JuraClient.close()` sends that.

### 5.2 Unsolicited frames (received)

| Prefix     | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `@TF:<hex>` | full machine status snapshot — alert bits, same layout as the discovery tail; **pushed periodically, never requested** |
| `@TV:<hex>` | brewing-in-progress / product progress — decoded, see §5.10 |
| `@TV:81,<text>` / `@TV:82,<text>` | language-download display lines — **not** progress |
| `@TV:84,<time>` | coffee-timer clock sync — **not** progress |
| `@TB` | brew started (sent right after an accepted `@TP:`, and 19 ms before the first `@TV:` of a hand-started brew) |
| `@TS` | **bare, no colon, no payload** — pushed 1.8 s after the last `ENJOY` of a captured brew, 3 ms before the `@TF:` broadcast resumed. Meaning unresolved; J.O.E. has no handler for it. See §9 |
| `@hu:<code>` | milk-cooler / OTA-family acknowledgement code — 3 hex chars (`800` seen on Kaffeebert); also carries `ok` / `wait` / `busy` / `abort` / `error` tails on other verbs |

#### `@TB` / `@TS` are markers, and a reader must skip them

`@TB` and `@TS` are the only pushes with **no colon and no payload**: a
bare two-letter uppercase verb and nothing else. That shape is the whole
rule — every reply in this protocol is lowercase (`@tp`, `@ts`,
`@tg:43…`, `@hu:800`) and every push is uppercase, so an uppercase
payloadless frame can never be an answer to a command.

They are not rare or brew-only: `@TB` opens a brew *and* a `@TS:01`
screen lock (§5.1), and the captured brew's `@TS` arrived ~10 s after the
last `ENJOY` — long enough to land on the socket while an unrelated
command is in flight. Anything reading replies must therefore skip them
the way it skips `@TF:` / `@TV:`, or it will hand a marker back as "the
reply". `jura_connect` does this in `JuraClient._await_frame` /
`request_raw` (recording each skipped marker in `status_history`), and
`brew()` additionally pins its own reply with `BREW_REPLY_MATCH`
(`(?i)^@(?:tp|an)\b`) so the accept / `@tp:00`-reject decision can only
be made from a real `@TP:` answer.

### 5.3 Maintenance counter layout (`@TG:43`, `@TG:C0`)

Big-endian u16 per counter after the `@tg:43` prefix — **but neither
the number of counters nor their order is universal.** Both are
declared per machine by the `<TEXTITEM Type=…>` children of the XML's
`<BANK Command="@TG:43">` element, and J.O.E. reads them from there:

```xml
<BANK Command="@TG:43" Name="Maintenance Counter">
  <TEXTITEM Type="Cleaning" Text="33"/>
  <TEXTITEM Type="FilterChange" Text="34"/>
  <TEXTITEM Type="Decalc" Text="35"/>
  <TEXTITEM Type="CappuRinse" Text="40"/>
  <TEXTITEM Type="CoffeeRinse" Text="36"/>
  <TEXTITEM Type="CappuClean" Text="41"/>
</BANK>
```

Across the 89 bundled profiles there are four variants (`Decalc` is
this library's `descale`):

| Fields (wire order) | Payload | Profiles |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `Cleaning, FilterChange, Decalc, CappuRinse, CoffeeRinse, CappuClean` | 12 B | 68 — incl. EF536 and EF1091 (Kaffeebert) |
| `Cleaning, FilterChange, Decalc, CoffeeRinse` | 8 B | 13 — EF1013, EF1031, EF1089, EF1105, EF1105V2, EF1115, EF1115V2, EF1124, EF1125, EF1128, EF529, EF532COFFEEONLY, EF534 |
| `Cleaning, FilterChange, Decalc, CoffeeRinse, CappuRinse, CappuClean` | 12 B | 7 — EF0000, EF1090, EF1123, EF1143, EF1148, EF1171, EF_MASTER |
| `Cleaning, Decalc, CappuRinse, CoffeeRinse, CappuClean` | 10 B | 1 — EF567_C (no filter) |

`@TG:C0` (one byte per field, `0xFF` = not applicable) is declared the
same way and is `Cleaning, FilterChange, Decalc` on all 89 profiles
except EF567_C, which is `Cleaning, Decalc`.

`MachineProfile.maintenance_counter_fields` /
`.maintenance_percent_fields` carry the parsed order;
`MaintenanceCounters.parse(reply, profile=…)` and
`MaintenancePercent.parse(reply, profile=…)` use it, and
`JuraClient.read_maintenance_counter` / `read_maintenance_percent`
pass the client's profile automatically. Without a profile the first
(EF536 / EF1091) variant is assumed — on any of the other 21 machines
that mislabels the counters, so pass `--machine-type`. Fields the
machine does not report read back as `None` and are omitted from
`format()` / `to_dict()`.

Live example from Kaffeebert (EF1091, baseline order):
```
@tg:4300150001000801580E21005B
       └┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘
       21  1  8 344 3617 91
```
The same 12 bytes on an EF1090 mean 344 `coffee_rinse` and 3617
`cappu_rinse` — the tail is swapped.

Re-read from the same machine on 2026-08-16
([capture §10](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)) after the
XML-declared field-order rewrite:

```
@tg:43001A000100090168109F005F
       └┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘
       26  1  9 360 4255 95
```

Every field moved monotonically upward from the earlier capture (21→26,
1→1, 8→9, 344→360, 3617→4255, 91→95), which confirms the field order
survived the rewrite unchanged on this machine.

`@TG:C0` from the same session: `@tg:C000FF46` → `cleaning=0
filter=255 descale=70`. The `0xFF` is the not-applicable sentinel (no
water filter fitted — the lifetime `filter_change` counter reads 1) and
is **passed through as the integer 255**, not suppressed;
`MaintenancePercent.format()` prints `filter=255`. Reading a percent
field as a percentage therefore requires treating 255 as "n/a".

### 5.4 Status bits (`@TF:`)

Bits are addressed **MSB-first within each byte**, indexed globally
across the frame. The APK's `Status.a()` is the canonical decoder:

```java
return ((1 << (7 - (i % 8))) & bArr[i / 8]) != 0;
```

So bit *N* lives at byte ``N // 8`` with mask ``1 << (7 - (N % 8))``.
This catches everyone who reads the XML and assumes naïve byte-LSB
indexing — prior to v0.9.0 this codebase had the bug and mis-named
every status bit by 7 positions per byte. The `<ALERT Bit="N" …>`
attribute in the machine XML uses the SAME N that the APK decoder
expects; only the byte/bit extraction matters.

The client decodes the well-known S8 alert set (cf.
`jura_connect.client._STATUS_BITS`) and groups each bit by the
*severity* lifted from the XML's `ALERT.Type` attribute:

| XML `Type` | Python severity | Meaning |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `block`    | `error`         | the machine is genuinely stuck and needs user action (insert tray, fill water, …) |
| `info` or none | `info`      | informational state or low-supply reminder (`no_beans` with `Blocked="C"`, `heating_up`, `coffee_ready`, …) — not an error, just a flag |
| `ip`       | `process`       | a "schedule maintenance" prompt (descale / cleaning / filter / cappu rinse alerts) shown *before* it actually blocks brewing |

Live frame from Kaffeebert at idle: `@TF:0004000008000000`. Byte 1 =
`0x04` → MSB-position 5 set → global bit 13 = `coffee_ready`
(severity `info`). Byte 4 = `0x08` → MSB-position 4 set → global bit
36 = `energy_safe` (severity `info`). The machine is idle in
energy-save mode and the previous coffee is ready — neither bit is
an error, which matches reality.

The `MachineStatus` dataclass exposes `errors`, `info`, and
`process` as separate tuples plus the unsplit `active_alerts` for
backwards compatibility; only the first should drive "is the machine
broken?" logic.

#### The display lock is visible in the status frame — **verified**

`@TS:01` / `@TS:00` (§9) do not only answer `@ts`; they move a status
bit. On Kaffeebert, 2026-08-16
([capture §9](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)):

```
idle            @TF:0004000008000000     byte 4 = 0x08
after @TS:01    @TF:0004000009000000     byte 4 = 0x09
after @TS:00    @TF:0004000008000000     byte 4 = 0x08
```

`0x09` sets MSB-positions 4 *and* 7 → global bits 36 and **39**.
EF1091's XML names bit 39 `LockedKeys`. That is an independent
confirmation of the MSB-first indexing above — a naïve byte-LSB reading
would have put the lock at bit 32 — and it gives a reliable way to
check from the outside whether a lock leaked: read the pushed `@TF:`
frame and look at bit 39.

The dongle broadcasts `@TF:` unprompted **every ~2.05 s** for the whole
life of a session (measured over five 20 s windows on the same
machine), so this check costs nothing but a wait.

### 5.5 Product brew counters (`@TR:32,<page>`)

The product counter table is paginated. The client issues 16
requests (`@TR:32,00` through `@TR:32,0F`); each reply has the form

```
@tr:32,<page_hex>,<8 hex bytes>
```

The 8-byte payload is four big-endian `u16` slot values. With 16
pages × 4 slots per page that gives a 64-slot table indexed by
product code:

* **Slot 0** carries the total number of brews ever performed on the
  machine.
* **Slots 1..63** carry the count for the product whose code matches
  the slot index, with `0xFFFF` reserved for "this code is not
  configured on this machine".

The product-code → human-name mapping comes from a `MachineProfile`
loaded by EF code (see §6 below). `jura_connect.client.PRODUCT_NAMES`
is the union map over the TT237W family (S8, ENA8, Z8, …) and is the
fallback when no profile is available. Profile-specific names take
precedence (`from_slots(slots, profile=…)`), so the S8 EB's `0x2B`
brews as `cortado` while the same code on the EF536 baseline is left
under `by_code`. Unknown codes always survive into
`ProductCounters.by_code` so a future firmware variant still surfaces
the raw count rather than dropping it on the floor.

Live first page from Kaffeebert (idle, after a few thousand brews):

```
@tr:32,00,0C9DFFFF004E0253
        └──┘└──┘└──┘└──┘
        3229 ----  78  595
        total       espresso  coffee
```

The second u16 (`FFFF`) is slot 1 = `ristretto` — not configured on
this S8 EB.

#### Counter slot ≠ product code on some machines

A product is normally counted at its own code, but not always: the
**Z10 (EF545) counts its two plain doubles one nibble above their
singles.** Its catalogue lists them at `0x31` ("2 Espressi") and `0x36`
("2 Coffee"), while the counters live at `0x12` and `0x13` and the
catalogue codes read `0xFFFF`.

This is a per-machine quirk, not a family rule. J.O.E. carries exactly
one such remap, built in `CoffeeMachineGenerator` as

```java
coffeeMachine.remap = str.equals("EF545")
        ? mapOf("31" to "12", "36" to "13") : emptyMap()
```

and consumed in `ProductCounterStatisticsParser`, which walks the
machine's *products* and reads each one from `remap[code] ?: code`.
`equals("EF545")` is the only machine-type special case anywhere in the
app, and the quirk is not derivable from the XML — EF545's and EF1091's
`<PRODUCT Code="31" …>` entries are identical down to `PosCSV`.

`jura_connect.client.COUNTER_SLOT_OVERRIDES` mirrors that table (with
one addition: if the override target reads `0xFFFF` on the machine in
front of us, the product's own code is used, so a firmware that counts
at the catalogue code keeps its counts). Machines outside the table are
untouched — an S8 EB (EF1091/EF1151) really does count its doubles at
`0x31`/`0x36`: reading one live gave `2_espressi` = 1 and `2_coffee` =
10, with `0x12`/`0x13` unused.

Both layouts can be cross-checked with the total: the machine bills a
double as two products, so `slot 0` minus the sum over the per-product
slots equals the number of double brews. Z10: 5945 − 5804 = 141 = the
`0x13` count. S8 EB: 3740 − 3729 = 11 = 1 + 10.

#### Other counter banks

`@TR:32` is one of several counter banks a machine's XML may declare
under `<PRODUCTCOUNTER>` (parsed into
`MachineProfile.counter_banks`):

…and, in a second section, under `<DAILYCOUNTER Reset="@TF:05">`
(`MachineProfile.daily_counter_banks` /
`MachineProfile.daily_counter_reset`). The full table, with the page
count and value width the client uses for each
(`jura_connect.client.COUNTER_BANK_SPECS`):

| Bank | Name | Section | Pages | Bytes/value | Profiles | Page count from |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@TR:32` | Product counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 16 | 2 | 89 / 89 | APK |
| `@TR:33` | Overflow product counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 16 | 1 | 34 | APK |
| `@TR:34` | Barista counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 16 | 2 | 4 | assumed |
| `@TR:35` | Overflow barista counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 16 | 1 | 3 | assumed |
| `@TR:42` | Daily product counter | DAILYCOUNTER | 16 | 2 | 37 | assumed |
| `@TR:43` | Overflow daily product counter | DAILYCOUNTER | 16 | 1 | 4 | assumed |
| `@TR:44` | Daily barista counter | DAILYCOUNTER | 16 | 2 | 4 | assumed |
| `@TR:45` | Overflow daily barista counter | DAILYCOUNTER | 16 | 1 | 4 | assumed |
| `@TR:52` | Special counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 4 | 2 | 14 | APK |
| `@TR:53` | Overflow special counter | PRODUCTCOUNTER | 4 | 1 | 4 | APK (WiFi) |

"APK" means J.O.E. issues exactly that many pages on the WiFi path;
"assumed" means no code path in the app touches the bank at all and the
client uses the product counter's 16 pages because the bank indexes the
same 64-slot product-code space. A machine that serves fewer pages
answers `@tr:00` early, which the reader honours (see below), so the
assumption costs at most one extra round trip.

The two flavours of the app disagree about `@TR:53`: the WiFi adapter
reads it with the 4-page `WifiCommandSpecialCounterStatistics`, the
Bluetooth one with `getStatisticsValues(15, "@TR:53", …, 1)` — 16
pages. This client follows the WiFi side, which is the transport it
speaks.

Only `@TR:32` has a dedicated result type (`ProductCounters`, whose
shape downstream consumers depend on). Every other bank decodes into
`CounterBank`, which carries the bank command and a `source` (how the
read was justified — see "the opt-in probe" below) alongside the same
`total` / `by_name` / `by_code` / `raw_slots` view. Slot 0 is the
bank's own total everywhere.

Slot naming differs by bank. The product, barista and daily banks index
the catalogue by product code, so profile product names apply (and so do
the `COUNTER_SLOT_OVERRIDES` above). The **special counter** does not:
its slots are fixed functions, per J.O.E.'s
`SpecialCounterStatisticsParser`, which builds a `SpecialCounterEmit`
out of

```
totalCounter    = slot 0
sweetFoam       = slot 3
coldBrew        = slot 4 + slot 5 + slot 6
strongColdBrew  = slot 9
lightBrew       = slot 12 + slot 13 + slot 14
```

(the app also reports `hotBrew` — reading slot 0, i.e. the same value
as the total, which looks like a copy/paste bug and is not reproduced
here). Slots outside that map still surface under `by_code`, so nothing
is dropped. `0xFFFF` counts as "not configured" and is skipped from the
sums, matching the app's `h()` helper.

The overflow banks carry **one byte per slot** holding the high word.
J.O.E. reads them exactly like `@TR:32` — 16 pages, `@TR:33,<page>` —
but with one byte per value instead of two. On the WiFi side
(`CoffeeMachineAdapterWifi.readProductStatistics`) that is literally the
same command class parameterised twice, and the overflow read happens
only when the machine's XML declares the bank:

```java
new WifiCommandProductCounterStatistics(machine, 2, "@TR:32")  // base
// then, iff a Bank with command "@TR:33" is present:
new WifiCommandProductCounterStatistics(machine, 1, "@TR:33")  // overflow
```

Bluetooth does the same through `readOverFlowCounter` →
`getStatisticsValues(15, "@TR:33", …, 1)`. Both flavours combine the two
banks in `StatisticStateEmit` as

```
count = value + (overflow << 16)
```

skipping overflow bytes of `0x00` ("no overflow yet") and `0xFF` (the
not-configured sentinel). Without the high byte a per-product count
wraps at 65535.

`jura_connect` reads an overflow bank when — and only when — the
machine's profile declares it, and folds it into its base bank
(`ProductCounters.from_slots(..., overflow=…)`,
`CounterBank.from_slots(...)`). An overflow bank is never readable on
its own: `JuraClient.read_counter_bank("@TR:33")` raises and points at
`@TR:32`. A machine may also declare the bank and still answer a bare
`@tr:00`; J.O.E.'s reply matcher accepts that shape
(`((@tr:33,<page>,.*)|(@tr:00))`) and so does the client, falling back
to the base table.

The same rule governs the base banks by default:
`JuraClient.read_counter_bank` sends nothing at all when the profile
does not declare the bank, and returns `None` — not an exception — for
both "not declared" and "the dongle answered `@tr:00` on page 0"
(`probe=True` lifts the first half of that; see below). Named commands
`special-counters`, `barista-counters`, `daily-brews` and
`daily-barista-counters` wrap the four base banks; `@TR:32` keeps its
own `brews`.

Bank sizes are not uniform: J.O.E.'s WiFi composite asks for 16 pages
of the product counter and its overflow, but only 4 pages of the
special counter (`WifiCommandSpecialCounterStatistics.j()` →
`IntRange(0, 3)`). The client therefore treats a `@tr:00` on a later
page as "bank ends here" and keeps the slots it did read; only a
`@tr:00` on the *first* page means "bank not implemented".

#### The daily banks are a machine capability the app ignores

37 of the 89 profiles carry

```xml
<DAILYCOUNTER Reset="@TF:05">
    <!-- Not available in JOE -->
    <BANK Command="@TR:42" Name="Daily Product counter"/>
    <BANK Command="@TR:43" Name="Daily Product counter overvlow" />
    <BANK Command="@TR:44" Name="Barista Counter Dayli"/>
    <BANK Command="@TR:45" Name="Overflow Barista counter Dayli"/>
</DAILYCOUNTER>
```

The `<!-- Not available in JOE -->` comment is Jura's own, and it holds
up: grepping the decompiled APK for `@TR:4[2-5]` returns nothing —
neither the WiFi nor either Bluetooth adapter ever asks for these
banks, and there is no parser for them. The machine keeps them anyway.
They are the per-product brew counts since the last reset, which is
exactly what a "coffees today" sensor wants, so this client reads them.

`@TF:05` is the XML's own `Reset` verb for the section — all 37
profiles spell it identically. It zeroes the daily banks irreversibly,
so it is in `DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES` and exposed only as the gated
`reset-daily-counters` command. Nothing in the app sends it either.

#### XML declaration ≠ firmware support — **verified, and it cuts both ways**

Kaffeebert (S8 EB / EF1091, TT237W, 2026-08-16 —
[capture §6](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)) was asked for
every non-`@TR:32` bank directly, with `raw`, bypassing the profile
gate:

| Frame | Reply |
| ----- | ----- |
| `@TR:52,00` | `@tr:52,00,FFFFFFFF0001000E` |
| `@TR:52,01` | `@tr:52,01,FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` |
| `@TR:52,02` | `@tr:52,02,0A65FFFFFFFFFFFF` |
| `@TR:52,03` | `@tr:52,03,FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` |
| `@TR:33,00` | `@tr:00` |
| `@TR:34,00` | `@tr:00` |
| `@TR:42,00` | `@tr:00` |
| `@TR:44,00` | `@tr:00` |
| `@TR:53,00` | `@tr:00` |

**The S8 EB implements `@TR:52` and holds live values in it — slot 2 =
1, slot 3 = 14, slot 8 = 0x0A65 = 2661 — while its XML declares only
`@TR:32`.** So a machine XML can *under*-declare: "declared in the
XML" and "supported by the firmware" are not the same set. The
4-page size is confirmed (all four pages answer, none early-terminates
with `@tr:00`), as is the `@tr:<bank>,<page>,<8 hex bytes>` reply
grammar for a bank other than `@TR:32`.

The five other banks answer the bare `@tr:00` rejection J.O.E.'s
matcher expects, so the XML is not wrong about *those* — and the
`@tr:00` shape itself is now hardware-observed rather than assumed.

##### The opt-in probe

Consequence for this client: `JuraClient.read_counter_bank` sends
**nothing** when the profile does not declare the bank, so
`special-counters` on an S8 EB reports "not declared" and never asks.
That stays the default — it is what J.O.E. does and it costs no round
trip — but the XML is now known to be a lower bound, so the read can be
opted into:

```
read_counter_bank(bank, probe=True)      # library
jura-connect command ... --probe special-counters   # CLI
```

`probe=True` sends the bank anyway and keeps the data if the machine
answers. A first-page `@tr:00` still means "not implemented" and still
returns `None`, exactly as for a declared bank, so the probe can only
add information. It also covers the probed bank's **overflow** bank
(`@TR:53` for `@TR:52`) — an undeclared bank has an undeclared overflow
bank, and without it a probed count would silently truncate at 65535;
that costs one further round trip and ends on the same `@tr:00`. It
reaches nothing else: not another bank, not another command, and never
anything that writes.

Probed data is a weaker claim than declared data, so the two are kept
apart rather than blurred. `CounterBank.source` records which it was —
`declared`, `probed`, or `unprofiled` (no profile loaded, so there was
no declaration to consult either way) — and both `format()` and
`to_dict()` say so; `to_dict()` additionally carries a plain
`"probed": true/false` for consumers such as the Home Assistant
integration.

Nobody has checked whether an *over*-declaring XML exists — a machine
that declares a bank its firmware rejects. That direction is already
safe: the declared read is sent, the machine answers `@tr:00`, and the
client reports "not implemented".

#### A bare `@TR:<bank>` draws no reply at all

`@TR:32` and `@TR:52` were both sent without a `,<page>` argument.
Neither drew any answer — the dongle just kept broadcasting `@TF:`
until the read timed out (10 s, twice). Bank reads are page-addressed
only; there is no "whole bank in one frame" form. The `register-read
<bank>` command therefore cannot succeed on this firmware and will
block for its full timeout; use `raw '@TR:<bank>,<page>'`.

### 5.6 Programmable-recipe slots (`@TM:50` + `@TM:42,<slot>`)

The dongle's "PMode" interface exposes a small table of user-editable
recipe slots. Reading it is a two-step exchange:

```
client → @TM:50
dongle → @tm:50,<hex bytes ending in a checksum>
```

The body has one byte per recipe **kind** (the number of which is
machine-specific — the J.O.E. APK's PModeRequester does not encode it,
it asks the machine), followed by a single checksum byte equal to the
sum of those kind-bytes. The Python client sums the body modulo 256
and rejects the reply when the checksum doesn't match. The total
number of slots is `sum(per_kind_counts)`.

```
client → @TM:42,<slot_hex>
dongle → @tm:42,<slot_hex><product_code><F2..Fn><checksum>  (configured)
dongle → @tm:C2                                  (slot not exposed here)
```

The reply's trailing byte is the same `ByteOperations.d` checksum the
settings write uses (§5.7), computed over `"42,<slot_hex><payload>"`.
`PModeSlotProductReadParser` verifies it and then indexes the payload
*after* the slot byte as `F1, F2, F3 …` — `F1` is the product code, so
argument `F<n>` lives at payload byte `n-1`, the same offset rule the
`@TP:` recipe blob uses (§5.9).

The S8 EB / EF1091 reports 20 slots via `@TM:50` (`@tm:50,0404040404` +
checksum `7A` — re-confirmed 2026-08-16, and the trailing byte is the
ordinary `ByteOperations.d` checksum over `"50,0404040404"`, not an
opaque one) but answers every `@TM:42,<n>` with `@tm:C2`. That is
the "machine reports a PMode table but doesn't make any of it
addressable" branch, and the machine's own XML agrees: EF1091 carries
`<MACHINESETTINGS Productprogramming="false">`.
`ProgramModeSlots.supported_by_machine` flips to `False` in that case,
and the CLI prints ``not supported by machine``.

The real machine also resets the TCP connection on some slot indices
mid-table; the client catches `(ConnectionError, OSError)` and marks
the remaining slots as unsupported rather than blowing up the whole
``pmode`` command.

#### 5.6.1 Where the XML declares PMode

There is **no `<PROGRAMMODE>` element** in Jura's schema. None of the
89 bundled XMLs has one, nor do the documented `EF0000` / `EF_MASTER`
templates. `MachineProfile.has_pmode` used to test for it and was
therefore always `False`. The machine declares product programming on
`<MACHINESETTINGS>` instead — the two attributes the APK's `XMLParser`
reads into `MachineSettings.productProgramming` / `.numberOfSlots`:

```xml
<MACHINESETTINGS Productprogramming="true"
                 NumberOfSlotsForProductProgramming="6">
```

| Declaration | Where | Count | `MachineProfile` |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| `Productprogramming="true\|false"` | `<MACHINESETTINGS>` | 57 profiles (20 true) | `.product_programming`, `.has_pmode` |
| `NumberOfSlotsForProductProgramming` | `<MACHINESETTINGS>` | 5 profiles (all `6`) | `.pmode_slot_count` |
| `ProductSettings="true\|false"` | `<PRODUCT>` | 1679 products | `ProductDef.product_settings` |
| `PModeAdjust="false"` | recipe parameter | 5 profiles | `ProductParam.pmode_adjust` |
| `IntakeF18="true"` | `<MACHINEMANIFEST><CAPABILITIES>` | 23 profiles | `.intake_f18` |

`PModeAdjust="false"` marks a parameter the product-programming UI
hides (EF529 does this for `COFFEE_STRENGTH`); `build_pmode_hex`
refuses to *override* such a parameter but still emits its XML
default. `ProductSettings="false"` marks a product that is not
programmable at all.

#### 5.6.2 The 17-byte PMode product blob

**APK-derived, never sent to a real machine.** From
`ch.toptronic.joe.model.product.AppProduct.d()`:

* 17 bytes pre-filled with `0x00`;
* byte `n-1` for every `Argument="F<n>"` parameter, in the same units
  and 5 ml tick encoding as the `@TP:` blob (§5.9) — the APK's
  `ProductArgument.b()` selects exactly `F4` / `F10` / `Text="94"`,
  which is our `_ML_TICK_KINDS`;
* byte 0 overwritten with the product code, last.

Two differences from the `@TP:` start blob, both deliberate:

* it is 17 bytes, not 16 — `F17` (grinder freeness) needs byte 16, and
  `d()` always allocates it. `@TP:` is this blob truncated to 16 bytes
  (17 when the product has `F17`), which is why §5.9's blob is shorter;
* **byte 8 is not forced to `0x01`.** That "recipe valid" byte belongs
  to `AppProduct.c()`, the `@TP:` path; the PMode write sends the raw
  parameter blob.

#### 5.6.3 Product settings write (`@TM:41`) — APK-derived, untested

`WifiCommandPModeProductWrite` builds `"41," + AppProduct.d()` and
appends `ByteOperations.d` over that same string:

```
client → @TS:01                              (lock, PMODE priority)
client → @TM:41,<34 hex blob><checksum>
dongle → @tm:41                              (stored)
dongle → @tm:C1                              (product programming unsupported)
dongle → @tm:00                              (write rejected)
client → @TS:00                              (unlock)
```

`JuraClient.write_pmode_product` sends this, returns `@an:error`
verbatim (as `write_setting` does) and raises `ValueError` for `C1` /
`00` — a rejection token is never success.

#### 5.6.4 Slot assignment write (`@TM:42`) — APK-derived, untested

From `CoffeeMachineAdapterBle2.sendPmodeProductCommandSlot` plus
`WifiCommandPModeSlotProductWrite.Companion.a`:

```
body = "42," + <slot hex> + <first 14 bytes of the blob> + <tail>
wire = "@TM:" + body + ByteOperations.d(body)
reply matcher: @tm:42,<slot hex>.*      (@tm:C2 = not supported)
```

The tail is where it gets strange:

| Condition | Tail | Body length |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| product has `F17` (grinder freeness) | `00 <F17> 00 00 00 00` | 20 bytes |
| no `F17`, but machine declares `IntakeF18` | `00 00 00 00 00 00` | 20 bytes |
| neither | *(nothing)* | 14 bytes |

Note the asymmetry: `F17` lands at blob index **15** here, not 16 as
in the full 17-byte blob, and the APK splices in the *unscaled*
`getValue("F17")` rather than the scaled byte `d()` computed. That may
well be a bug in J.O.E., but it is what the app puts on the wire, so
`JuraClient.write_pmode_slot` copies it.

#### 5.6.5 Rejection tokens

| Token | Command | APK source | Meaning | Seen on hardware |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| `@tm:C1` | `@TM:41` | `PModeProductReadParser` | "Machine does not support Product Programming" | **yes** — S8 EB, 2026-08-16 |
| `@tm:C2` | `@TM:42` | `PModeSlotProductReadParser` | "Product code, slot, or function is not supported by machine" | **yes** — S8 EB, all 20 slots |
| `@tm:D0` | `@TM:50` | `PModeNumSlotReadParser` | no programmable slots | no (the S8 EB answers `@TM:50` successfully) |
| `@tm:00` | either write | dongle generic | write rejected | no |

None of these is a success reply. Reads map them to `None`; writes
raise. `jura_connect.client._PMODE_NOT_SUPPORTED` is the single table
both paths consult.

All three read tokens fit the general `addr | 0x80` rule documented in
§5.7 (`0x41|0x80 = 0xC1`, `0x42|0x80 = 0xC2`, `0x50|0x80 = 0xD0`) —
they are not PMode-specific magic numbers but the dongle's generic
"unimplemented `@TM:` address" answer.

### 5.7 Machine settings (`@TM:<arg>` read / write)

Every machine XML carries a ``<MACHINESETTINGS>`` block. Each
``SWITCH`` / ``COMBOBOX`` / ``SLIDER`` element has a ``P_Argument``
attribute (e.g. ``"02"`` for hardness on EF1091); reading the setting
is

```
client → @TM:<P_Argument>
dongle → @tm:<P_Argument>,<value_hex><csum>
```

**A read echoes the same trailing checksum a write sends** — it is not
a bare value. `<csum>` is the two hex chars described further down this
section (`(-1 - sum("<P_Argument>,<value_hex>")) & 0xFF`), and
:meth:`jura_connect.client.JuraClient.read_setting` verifies it before
returning the value with it stripped.

Folding the check byte into the value is the obvious failure mode and
it is silent: every setting decodes to a plausible-looking but wrong
number, and short values alias onto other catalogue entries rather than
going out of range. Observed on a Z10 (NAA, EF545) — the fourth column
is what a decoder that keeps the check byte reports:

| Setting | Arg | Reply | Value | Naively decoded as |
| ------- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------------------ |
| Hardness | `02` | `0110` | `01` (1°dH) | 272°dH |
| AutoOFF | `13` | `1EF9` | `1E` (30min) | — |
| Units | `08` | `22010046` | `220100` (oz) | — |
| Language | `09` | `0208` | `02` (english) | `08` = russian |
| Brightness | `0A` | `07FB` | `07` (70%) | 2043% |

The language row is the dangerous one: `0208` ends in `08`, which is
russian's own code, so a decoder that suffix-matches the catalogue
reports a confidently wrong answer instead of an obviously broken one.
(`read_setting`'s docstring records the same class of bug from v0.9.0,
where hardness=13 came back as 3581.)

Writing is the same address with a value and a trailing checksum
byte, **wrapped in @TS:01 / @TS:00**:

```
client → @TS:01                              (lock keypad)
dongle → @ts
client → @TM:<P_Argument>,<value_hex><csum>  (the write)
dongle → @tm:<P_Argument>                    (success — echo of the address)
dongle → @an:error                           (rejected — checksum or value bad)
client → @TS:00                              (release keypad)
dongle → @ts
```

The wrapping is non-optional on TT237W firmware: omit it and the
dongle still ACKs the bare ``@TM:`` write with ``@tm:<arg>``
(looking like success) but the machine silently ignores the new
value until the next power cycle. The J.O.E. APK enforces this by
dispatching every ``CommandPriority.PMODE`` command — which is the
default for ``WifiCommandWritePMode`` — through a
``PriorityChannel`` branch that prepends ``@TS:01`` and appends
``@TS:00``. The Python port now mirrors that wrap in
:meth:`jura_connect.client.JuraClient.write_setting`; releases
0.9.0 - 0.9.1 omitted it, which is why settings appeared to write
successfully but never took effect.

In addition, **the cleartext body must end with `\r\n` before the
cipher runs** (see §1.1). TT237W's failure mode for a missing inner
CRLF is the opposite of the missing lock/unlock wrapper: instead of
ACKing with ``@tm:<arg>``, the dongle ACKs with ``@tm:00`` (the
rejection token) and the value never changes. Releases 0.9.0-0.9.2
hit this on every write. Discovered by pcap-decoding the J.O.E.
Android app's AutoOFF write on Kaffeebert (``192.168.111.192``);
every J.O.E. body carries the trailing CRLF inside the cipher body.

#### ItemSlider value storage (AutoOFF on EF1091)

``ItemSlider`` settings like AutoOFF (``P_Argument="13"``) use a
1-byte *type-tag* prefix on the wire:

* ``21<vv>`` — 1-byte unsigned value ``vv`` follows
  (``211E`` = 30 dec = 30min, ``213C`` = 60 dec = 1h)
* ``22<vvvv>`` — 2-byte unsigned value ``vvvv`` follows
  (``220168`` = 360 dec = 6h, ``22021C`` = 540 dec = 9h)
* ``0F`` — a one-byte literal value with no tag (15min)

The dongle persists only the value bytes for the ``21`` form (so
writing ``211E`` and then reading ``@TM:13`` gives back ``1E``) but
returns the literal value including the ``22`` tag for the
two-byte form (writing ``220168`` reads back ``220168``).
:meth:`jura_connect.client.JuraClient.write_setting` accepts both
shapes when verifying the readback, and the CLI's
``setting auto_off`` lookup falls back to suffix-matching the
ItemSlider catalogue so ``1E`` resolves to ``30min``.

The checksum is two upper-case hex chars computed by the J.O.E. APK's
``ByteOperations.d``: sum the codepoint of every char in
``"<P_Argument>,<value_hex>"``, format ``(-1 - sum) & 0xFF``. The
Python port is in
``jura_connect.client._settings_checksum``.

Each EF code's ``<MACHINESETTINGS>`` block enumerates the user-tunable
settings. On EF1091 (S8 EB) the seven settings are:

| Name | Kind | Arg | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| Hardness | StepSlider | `02` | 1..30°dH, step 1, mask `FF` |
| AutoOFF | ItemSlider | `13` | 15min..9h, 11 named ITEMs (1-byte + 3-byte values mixed) |
| Units | Switch | `08` | `00`=mL / `01`=oz |
| Language | Combobox | `09` | 11 languages, `01`=German .. `0B`=Estonian |
| DisplayBrightnessSetting | Combobox | `0A` | 10..100% in 10% steps, `01`..`0A` |
| MilkRinsing | Combobox | `04` | `00`=Automatic / `01`=Manual |
| Frother Instructions | Switch | `62` | `01`=On / `00`=Off |

``jura_connect.profile.SettingDef`` carries the parsed catalogue;
``SettingDef.normalise_value`` validates user-supplied input (range
+ step for sliders, item name OR raw hex for switches/comboboxes)
before the write is sent. The CLI's ``setting`` command goes through
both validation and the destructive gate.

#### Catalogue shape across all 89 profiles

`<MACHINESETTINGS>` only ever contains four element kinds, all of
which `MachineProfile` parses: `SWITCH` (91 across the bundle),
`COMBOBOX` (122), `SLIDER` with `SliderType="StepSlider"` (46) or
`"ItemSlider"` (44), plus the `BANK` declaration below. Notes from the
survey:

* 32 of the 89 profiles carry **no** `<MACHINESETTINGS>` block at all
  (the older T-protocol families — `EF532`…`EF567`, `EF657`…`EF722`,
  including the synthetic `EF536` fallback baseline). On those, there
  is nothing to read and no settings bank.
* Every `COMBOBOX` carries `Read="TM:<P_Argument>"`, which is
  redundant with `P_Argument` in 121 of 122 cases (the 122nd is an
  empty string). Nothing is parsed from it.
* `Mask` is **not** slider-only: the ESM switch (`P_Argument="07"`)
  in the `EF0000` / `EF_MASTER` templates carries `Mask="01"`.
  `SettingDef.mask` now keeps it for every kind.
* Settings arguments the J.O.E. mock exercises but EF1091 lacks are
  ordinary catalogue entries elsewhere in the bundle and need no
  special handling: `1F` (TimeFormat, a `SWITCH`, 10 profiles) and
  `0A` (DisplayBrightnessSetting, a `COMBOBOX`, present on EF1091).
* A `P_Argument` may legitimately appear twice in one block (`1E` is
  both "Operating instructions" and "Aroma Control Instructions" in
  the template); the first declaration wins, matching J.O.E.

#### Batch settings read (`@TM:00,FC`) — **rejected by the S8 EB**

57 of the 89 profiles declare, inside `<MACHINESETTINGS>`:

```xml
<BANK Name="Setting" Command="@TM:00,FC" CommandArgument="02080913"/>
```

`CommandArgument` is a concatenation of two-hex-digit `P_Argument`
codes — `02` hardness, `08` units, `09` language, `13` auto-off —
i.e. one round trip instead of four. The declaration is **identical**
in all 57 (same command, same argument list); 16 of them name
arguments their own `<MACHINESETTINGS>` block never declares (e.g.
`EF1096` has neither `02`, `08` nor `13`), so the list is Jura
boilerplate rather than per-machine truth.

What the APK says about it: **nothing**. `XMLParser.e()` parses
`CommandArgument` into the `Bank` model, whose constructor then throws
it away (it keeps only name, command and text items). No
`WifiCommand*` class issues `@TM:00,…`; the WiFi settings path is
`WifiCommandReadPModeComposite`, which fans out into one
`WifiCommandReadPMode` (`@TM:<arg>`) per `SettingElement`. So the app
declares the bank and then never uses it.

`jura_connect` therefore sends the XML's `Command` verbatim, the same
way it treats every other `<BANK Command="…">`, and applies a strict,
guessed decoder modelled on the single-setting read:

```
client → @TM:00,FC
dongle → @tm:00,<v1><v2><v3><v4><csum>   (assumed success)
dongle → @tm:00                          (rejection — no batch read)
```

* values are concatenated in `CommandArgument` order and
  self-delimited by the ItemSlider type tags (`21` = one value byte
  follows, `22` = two, anything else *is* a one-byte value) — the only
  way a concatenated run can be split at all, since AutoOFF alone is
  1, 2 or 3 bytes wide;
* `<csum>` is the usual `ByteOperations.d` over `"00,<values>"`.

**Hardware answer (Kaffeebert, S8 EB / EF1091, TT237W, 2026-08-16 —
see [`captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md`](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)
§1):**

```
client → @TM:00,FC
dongle → @tm:80              <-- rejection, not a value payload
client → @TM:00              (bare, no argument)
dongle → @tm:80              <-- same answer
```

The machine **does not implement the bank it declares**. `@tm:80` is
the `addr | 0x80` rejection token (see below): address `00` is not a
readable `@TM:` address on this firmware at all, so the `,FC`
argument is irrelevant and no request-side checksum can change the
outcome. The guessed reply layout above was never reached and remains
unverified — it should be treated as speculation until a machine is
found that answers.

`read_settings_bank(checksum=True)` still exists for probing the
`@TM:00,FCEA` form on other machines; it was deliberately **not** sent
to Kaffeebert, because a valid checksum is exactly what makes
`@TM:<addr>,<value><csum>` look like a well-formed *write*, and the
bare read had already settled the question.

What this run *did* confirm is the fallback design.
`JuraClient.read_all_settings()` treats the batch read as an
optimisation only: any rejection, checksum failure, or value-count
mismatch is caught and the settings are re-read one `@TM:<arg>` at a
time. On Kaffeebert it caught the `ValueError`, recorded
`batch_error`, and read all seven catalogue entries individually with
correct values. **A wrong guess costs a round trip, never a wrong
value** — now observed, not asserted.

Note also that `CommandArgument="02080913"` covers only 4 of the 7
settings EF1091 actually exposes (`0A`, `04` and `62` are missing), so
even a working batch read would not replace the per-setting path.

#### `@tm:<addr | 0x80>` is the `@TM:` rejection token — **verified**

Every `@TM:` read the S8 EB refused came back as the *requested
address with bit 7 set*:

| Request | Reply | `addr \| 0x80` |
| ------- | ----- | -------------- |
| `@TM:00` / `@TM:00,FC` | `@tm:80` | `0x00 \| 0x80` |
| `@TM:23` (max languages) | `@tm:A3` | `0x23 \| 0x80` |
| `@TM:41,<code>` (PMode product) | `@tm:C1` | `0x41 \| 0x80` |
| `@TM:42,<slot>` (PMode slot) | `@tm:C2` | `0x42 \| 0x80` |
| `@TM:50` (PMode slot count) | `@tm:D0` | `0x50 \| 0x80` (per the APK parser; this machine answers successfully) |

This unifies four constants the code carried as unrelated magic
numbers. A `@tm:` reply whose address byte is `request | 0x80` means
"this machine does not implement that address" — regardless of which
address it is. Verified against five requests on TT237W V06.11; no
counter-example seen.

#### Limit load (`@TM:60,<product code><csum>`) — **verified on hardware**

`WifiCommandReadLimitLoad` asks the machine for the ranges it will
accept for one product *right now*, which is what J.O.E. bounds its
product sliders with instead of the static XML `Min`/`Max`:

```
client → @TM:60,<product code><csum>       csum = ByteOperations.d("60,<code>")
dongle → @tm:60,<code><5 min/max pairs><csum>
dongle → @tm:C1                            (no product programming on this machine)
```

Decoded by `LimitLoadParser`:

1. strip `@tm:`, require the `60` address (`C1` means "machine does
   not support Product Programming" and aborts the read);
2. the last two chars are a `ByteOperations.d` checksum over
   `"60,<body>"` — same algorithm as the settings read/write;
3. `<body>` is the echoed product code (which must match the request)
   followed by **exactly five min/max byte pairs**, in this fixed
   order regardless of what the product declares:

   | Slot | Arg | Parameter |
   | ---- | --- | --------- |
   | 1 | `F4` | water amount |
   | 2 | `F5` | milk amount |
   | 3 | `F6` | milk foam amount |
   | 4 | `F10` | bypass |
   | 5 | `F11` | milk break |

4. a pair with `FF` for min or max means "not applicable" and is
   dropped, as is any pair for a parameter the product's XML does not
   declare;
5. surviving values are scaled by that parameter's XML `Step` — 5 for
   water/bypass (so the bytes are 5 ml ticks, matching §5.9), 1 for
   the milk parameters (seconds).

Example (EF1091 Cappuccino, `04`): body `04` `0530` `FFFF` `012D`
`FFFF` `FFFF` decodes to water 25..240 ml and milk foam 1..45 s, with
milk / bypass / milk-break not applicable.

**Verified against Kaffeebert (S8 EB / EF1091, TT237W, 2026-08-16 —
[capture §3](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)).** Seven products
were read; the request form, the request checksum, the five-pair
positional layout and the per-parameter scaling all hold exactly as
described above:

```
@TM:60,020B  → @tm:60,020310FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0087   espresso
@TM:60,030A  → @tm:60,030530FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0082   coffee
@TM:60,0706  → @tm:60,070530FFFF012DFFFF003C0001   latte macchiato
@TM:60,0805  → @tm:60,08FFFFFFFF012DFFFFFFFF006E   milk foam
@TM:60,0AFC  → @tm:60,0AFFFF012DFFFFFFFFFFFF0065   milk
@TM:60,0DF9  → @tm:60,0D053CFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF005E   hot water portion
@TM:60,2803  → @tm:60,280310FFFFFFFF0030FFFF00D4   café barista
```

Each product lights up exactly the pairs its XML declares — `milk`
only pair 2 (`F5`), `milk_foam` only pair 3 (`F6`), `café barista`
pairs 1 and 4 (`F4` + `F10` bypass), `latte macchiato` pairs 1, 3 and
5 (`F4` + `F6` + `F11` milk break) — which independently confirms the
slot→`F<n>` mapping above.

Two refinements the wire adds:

* the request checksum is **required and accepted**; the reply's
  trailing checksum verifies against `ByteOperations.d` in every case;
* between the fifth pair and the checksum the machine sends **one
  trailing `00` byte** (13 payload bytes total, not 12). It was `00`
  for all seven products; its meaning is unknown.

`@TM:60` reports the **continuous sliders only**. The S8 EB answered
`FFFF` for every product's coffee strength and temperature even though
its XML declares both as settable choice lists — those stay bounded by
the XML.

`JuraClient.read_limit_load()` returns a `ProductLimits` whose
`allows(kind, value)` bounds a brew against the machine's live limits.

### 5.8 **Destructive** commands — gated behind `--allow-destructive-commands`

These were observed in the EF536 machine XML or the APK and are
exposed as named registry commands but gated behind
`--allow-destructive-commands` (or `allow_destructive=True` for
library callers). The simulator returns `@an:error` for them as a
test-suite guardrail; running them via `raw '@TG:24'` is gated by
the same prefix check.

| Command | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| `@TG:21` | start `CappuClean` |
| `@TG:23` | start `CappuRinse` |
| `@TG:24` | start `Cleaning` |
| `@TG:25` | start descaling (`descale` command) |
| `@TG:26` | start `FilterChange` |
| `@TG:7E` | skip a quality-assistant step (`WifiCommandCancelQualityAssistantStep`); bare = one step, `@TG:7E,FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` = all. **Also observed zeroing every maintenance counter on TT237W** — see below |
| `@TF:02` | restart machine |
| `@TF:05` | zero the `<DAILYCOUNTER>` banks (`reset-daily-counters`); XML-declared `Reset` verb, irreversible, never sent by J.O.E. — see §5.5 |
| `@AN:02` | power off |
| `@TP:<recipe blob>` | start brewing a product — see §5.9 |
| `@HW:01,<pin>` | set machine PIN |
| `@HW:80,<ssid>` | set WiFi SSID |
| `@HW:81,<pwd>` | set WiFi password |
| `@HW:82,<name>` | set dongle name |

Use these only via raw `JuraClient.request()` and only with explicit
intent — running `@TG:24` will start a real cleaning cycle.

**`@TG:7E` — two readings, both irreversible.** The APK names it
`WifiCommandCancelQualityAssistantStep`, and that is how the app uses
it. But an accidental `@TG:7E` during this project's early probing
zeroed the maintenance counters on a real TT237W S8 EB, which is why it
was named `reset-counters` here for a long time. Both behaviours may
exist across firmware families; nobody should re-probe this on hardware
to find out. The registry exposes it as `skip-quality-step [one|all]`,
still gated, with a danger string that states both readings.

**`@TG:FF` is not destructive.** It was listed here as "reset
(something)"; the APK shows `WifiCommandCancelProductStep`, i.e. cancel
whatever product step is running. It moved to §5.1 and to the
non-gated `cancel` command.

Two more writes are destructive but are **not** in
`DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES`, because the list is matched as a byte prefix
and the same prefixes carry the corresponding *reads*; only the
payload length distinguishes them. They are gated on the
`CommandSpec` instead, exactly like the settings write:

| Wire | Command | Gate |
| ---- | ------- | ---- |
| `@TM:<arg>,<val><csum>` | `setting <name> <value>` | `dynamic_danger` |
| `@TM:41,<blob><csum>` | `pmode-set-product` | `destructive=True` — §5.6.3 |
| `@TM:42,<slot><blob><csum>` | `pmode-set-slot` | `destructive=True` — §5.6.4 |

The simulator applies the same refuse-by-default guardrail to the two
PMode writes via `SimulatorConfig.pmode_writable`.

### 5.9 Product start (`@TP:`) — the recipe blob (verified live)

Verified by **physically brewing** on a **JURA S8 EB / EF1091**
(owner's machine "kaffeebert", 2026-07) and, independently, on an
**E6** (upstream PR author's machine). Brewing works, but **not** with
a bare product code and **not** with the FF-padded blob earlier
versions of this library sent — both are ACKed and then silently
ignored. What the machine executes is a **16-byte recipe blob whose
unused bytes are `0x00` and whose byte 8 is a constant `0x01`**:

```
@TP:28000709000001000109000000000000   (cafe_barista, strength 7, 45 ml, normal, bypass 45 ml)
     │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └────────────── bytes 10..15: 00 (unused here)
     │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────────── byte 9:  bypass, 5 ml ticks (0x09 = 9 = 45 ml)
     │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └────────────────── byte 8:  0x01 — constant "recipe valid" byte
     │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────────────── byte 7:  00 (unused here)
     │ │ │ │ │ └────────────────────── byte 6:  temperature (00 low / 01 normal / 02 high)
     │ │ │ │ └──────────────────────── byte 5:  milk-foam amount, seconds (unused here)
     │ │ │ └────────────────────────── byte 4:  00 (unused here)
     │ │ └──────────────────────────── byte 3:  water amount, 5 ml ticks (0x09 = 9 = 45 ml)
     │ └────────────────────────────── byte 2:  coffee strength level (0x07 = 7)
     └──────────────────────────────── byte 0:  product code (byte 1 unused = 00)
```

* **Padding is `0x00`, and byte 8 is always `0x01`.** An FF-padded
  blob (`@TP:28FF0709FFFF01FFFF09FF…`) is ACKed `@tp:00` and does
  **nothing** — no `@TB`/`@TV` frames, counter unchanged, tried both
  single- and double-send. The 00-padded, byte-8=01 form brews on the
  first send. Byte 8 is a fixed structural byte: no bundled product
  carries a parameter there (nothing uses `Argument="F9"`).
* **Byte positions come from the machine XML.** Every PRODUCT element
  lists its parameters with an `Argument="F<n>"` attribute
  (GRINDER_RATIO at F2, COFFEE_STRENGTH at F3, WATER_AMOUNT at F4,
  MILK_FOAM_AMOUNT at F6, TEMPERATURE at F7, BYPASS at F10,
  MILK_BREAK at F11). The F-numbers are the byte offsets of the
  *Bluetooth* start-product command, which carries a leading key byte;
  the WiFi blob does not, so **blob offset = F − 1**.
* **EF566 F2 is the left:right grinder ratio.** A GIGA 6 physically
  brewed Espresso with both endpoint values: `100_0=00` moved beans
  only in the left hopper, while `0_100=04` moved beans only in the
  right hopper. Both brews completed normally. The profile's middle
  choices are `75_25=01`, `50_50=02` and `25_75=03`; they follow the
  same declared left:right scale but were not individually observed.
  See [`EF566_GRINDER_RATIO.md`](EF566_GRINDER_RATIO.md).
* **Water and bypass are sent in 5 ml ticks** (`ml / 5`, one byte).
  XML `Value`/`Min`/`Max` attributes are in ml. Milk foam and milk
  break are seconds, sent as-is; strength is the level number;
  temperature is the ITEM value (00/01/02).
* **Live-verified:** water, temperature, strength and bypass, from the
  three cross-model vectors (S8 EB `cafe_barista`, E6 `espresso`, E6
  `coffee`). `milk_amount` (F5) and `milk_foam_amount` (F6) are
  live-verified on a **Z10 (EA) / EF545** — blob
  `05000812030202000100000000000000` (Milkcoffee, milk 3 s, foam 2 s),
  brewed with the physical pour matching both phases. **Still not
  individually live-verified — may misbrew, verify on your hardware:**
  `milk_break` (seconds, sent as-is).
* **`0x00` means "parameter not set"** — for parameters the product
  doesn't have. A water byte the product *does* have must still be set
  explicitly: with 00-padding an unset water byte is `0x00` = **no
  water** (a dry/short shot), so `build_recipe_hex` refuses to leave it
  unset rather than guess.
* Cross-model verified vectors (all 00-padded, byte 8 = 01):
  `@TP:28000709000001000109000000000000` (S8 EB cafe_barista),
  `@TP:02000809000002000100000000000000` (E6 default espresso),
  `@TP:0300021A000001000100000000000000` (E6 coffee, strength 2,
  130 ml, normal).
* No trailing checksum is needed (unlike `@TM:` writes), and no
  `@TS:01`/`@TS:00` lock wrapper is required.
* Reply behaviour: the dongle ACKs an **accepted** blob with a bare
  `@tp`, then emits `@TB` when the brew starts, a run of `@TV:` progress
  frames (second-to-last byte = percent 0x00–0x64), and `@TV:3E<code>`
  on completion. A **rejected/ignored** blob gets `@tp:00` and no
  further frames — `@tp:00` is *not* an accept.
  The earlier form of this bullet said the progress frames are
  `@TV:41<code>…` with the tick at byte 4 and the target at byte 5.
  The full capture in
  [`2026-08-16-kaffeebert-brew-progress.md`](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-brew-progress.md)
  shows that is the `@TV:3C…` (water) frame; the `@TV:41…` frames that
  follow it carry the *bypass* pair at bytes 8/9 and leave bytes 4/5
  frozen. See §5.10.
* A machine in `energy_safe` wakes on the first `@TP:` but may ignore
  that first command; a retry then brews. `JuraClient.brew(retry=True)`
  opts into resending the blob once if the first reply is not an accept
  (bare `@tp`). With the correct 00-pad/byte-8=01 layout it brews on
  the first send, so the retry is usually moot.
* **Untested variants — verify on your hardware.** Live end-to-end
  verification covers single-boiler coffee machines (S8 EB / EF1091
  by the maintainer, E6 by the upstream PR author) and the GIGA 6 /
  EF566 grinder-ratio endpoints above. Other twin models remain
  untested — their blob layout or physical orientation may differ;
  report back if a brew is ACKed `@tp` but nothing pours.
* The dongle serves **one TCP session at a time**. Back-to-back
  commands may hit a connection refusal for a moment after the previous
  session closes — wait briefly and retry.
* Brew builds the blob from the machine **profile**, so a machine whose
  dongle stays silent on UDP discovery (no auto-detected EF code) must
  have its model set once — `set-machine-type <name> <EF>` (or
  `--machine-type <EF>`) — before `products` / `brew` resolve products
  against the right catalogue instead of the EF536 baseline.

The named `brew` command builds this blob from the machine profile —
`brew hotwater water=220 temp=high` — validating every value against
the XML catalogue (range, step, allowed items) before it goes on the
wire. `JuraClient.brew()` / `ProductDef.build_recipe_hex()` are the
library entry points; a full hex blob is still accepted verbatim as
an escape hatch for firmware variants with a different layout.

The `products` command lists every brewable product on the connected
machine with its resolvable name and each `param=value` key's allowed
values (ranges/steps for water & milk, item choices for strength &
temperature) — built from the same profile, with no extra machine
I/O. Use it to discover exactly what `brew` accepts.

#### 5.9.1 Preselections in the blob — **APK-derived, not verified**

Everything above this line was verified by physically brewing.
Everything in this subsection was **not**: it is transcribed from the
J.O.E. APK and has never been seen on a wire.

A *preselection* is the extra-shot / double / powder / cold-brew /
light-brew / sweet-foam toggle J.O.E. shows next to a product. It
touches the `@TP:` blob in one of two mutually exclusive ways, chosen
purely by the machine's `IntakeF18` capability:

| machine | how a preselection is expressed |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| no `<MACHINEMANIFEST>` (old T-protocol, incl. the S8 EB / EF1091) | `double` → **a different product code** in byte 0; `powder`/`coldbrew`/`lightbrew`/`xtrashot` → **one fixed byte overwritten** in the 16-byte blob; everything else → **not expressible** |
| `<CAPABILITIES IntakeF18="true"/>` | no product swap, no overwrite: an **extra mask byte** appended, blob grows to **20 bytes** |

The full derivation, byte values and open questions are in §5.13. Only
the *product-code* half has independent corroboration (§5.5: the S8 EB
counts its doubles at the separate slots `0x31` / `0x36`); the byte
overwrites and the mask byte have none.

---

### 5.10 Product progress (`@TV:`) — the live state machine

Unsolicited frames the machine pushes while it is doing something:
brewing, running a maintenance process, counting a coffee timer down,
showing an aroma preselection. This is what turns "an alert bit is
set" into "brewing, 60 %".

```
@TV:<hex payload>
```

**Provenance.** The layout below was **APK-derived** — decompiled from
`Progress`, `ProgressParser`, `ProgressState`, `ProductProgressState`
and `ProductArgument` in J.O.E. 4.6.10. The **coffee path is now
hardware-confirmed**: a full raw capture of a hand-started
`cafe_barista` on an S8 EB / EF1091 decoded all 32 of its `@TV:` frames
with zero failures
([`2026-08-16-kaffeebert-brew-progress.md`](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-brew-progress.md)).
Everything that brew exercised is marked **[live]** below and every
number in it is quoted from that capture; everything it did not touch
— the milk and steam states, the `8F` extended window, the process /
coffee-timer / P-mode / quality-assistant frame types — stays
**[APK, untested]**.

#### Payload layout

Byte indexes are into the hex payload (`byte(i)` = hex chars
`2i..2i+2`).

| byte | meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 0 | progress-state code (table below) |
| 1 | product code (product frames) or process code (process frames) |
| 2 | either the `8F` window marker, or the first value byte |

The **value window** is byte 2 onward, or byte 3 onward when byte 2 is
`8F` *and* the frame is a product/process frame. All indexes below
index the window, not the payload:

| idx | slot (`ProductArgument`) |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 0 / 1 | actual / max coffee strength |
| 2 / 3 | actual / max water volume |
| 4 / 5 | actual / max milk time |
| 6 / 7 | actual / max milk-foam time — doubles as steam temperature and as bypass water |
| 8 | max water temperature |
| 9 / 10 | actual / max pause time |
| 11 | `INTAKE_PERCENTAGE` (**not** what the app reads) |
| 12 | percentage 0x00–0x64 — J.O.E. reads the percent from **12**, not 11. Mirror the app; do not "fix" it |
| 13 | invalid / padding |

A 16-byte payload (2 head + 14 window) therefore puts the percentage
at payload byte 14, the second-to-last byte, and window slots 2/3 land
on payload bytes 4/5. **[live]** Both are confirmed frame by frame in
the brew capture: every one of its 32 frames was exactly 16 bytes with
the percentage at byte 14 (`00` → `64`, monotone, always a multiple of
10), and the water tick/target sat at bytes 4/5 throughout the `3C`
phase. The frame is decoded defensively: any slot the payload is too
short to reach decodes as `None` rather than raising — which the
capture also exercised, because the `ENJOY` frame is a bare `@TV:3E28`
with no window at all. **[live]**

The percentage is a **whole-product** figure, not a per-phase one:
during the captured brew it ran 0 → 60 % across the water phase and
60 → 100 % across the bypass phase. **[live]** `actual`/`maximum` (and
therefore `fraction`) are per-phase and reach 1.0 more than once per
product, so a progress bar must follow `percent` and must not recompute
it from the tick pair.

Tick counts are **reported, not interpolated**: the captured water
ticks went 0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,5,7,7,8,9 (no 6) and the bypass ticks
0,1,1,4,6,8,9. Gaps and repeats are normal. **[live]**

Slots a product does not use read `FF`: `cafe_barista` left slots 4/5
(milk time) and 9/10 (pause) at `FF` in every frame. **[live]** Slots
8 and 11 carried a constant `0x11` for the whole brew — unexplained,
see §9.

#### Which slots a state reports

Only some states carry a live value pair; for the rest the decoder
falls back to "window slot 0 is the value" (plus slot 1 as the maximum
in an `8F` frame). **[APK, untested]** except where marked.

| state | reports | actual idx | max idx | evidence |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| `19` | SMART_ALERT_PAUSE | 0 | 1 | APK, untested |
| `31` | MILK_FOAM_BEAN_AMOUNT | 0 | 1 | APK, untested |
| `32` | MILK_FOAM_MILK_VOLUME | 4 | 5 | APK, untested |
| `33` | MILK_FOAM_PAUSE | 9 | 10 | APK, untested |
| `34` | MILK_FOAM_VOLUME | 6 | 7 | APK, untested |
| `37` | MILK_FOAM_WATER_VOLUME | 2 | 3 | APK, untested |
| `39` | COFFEE_BEAN_AMOUNT | 0 | 1 | **[live]** 7/7 while grinding |
| `3C` | COFFEE_WATER_AMOUNT | 2 | 3 | **[live]** 0→9 ticks = 45 ml |
| `40` | HOTWATER_TEMPERATURE | 8 | 8 | APK, untested |
| `41` | HOTWATER_VOLUME | 2 | 3 | APK, untested (see below) |
| `41` | BYPASS_WATER_VOLUME (see below) | 6 | 7 | **[live]** 0→9 ticks = 45 ml |
| `43` | STEAM_TEMPERATURE | 6 | 7 | APK, untested |

State `39` reports the **configured** strength, not a countdown: the
capture's four grind frames all read 7/7, and 7 is the strength in the
`@TP:` blob that brews the same product (§5.9). Do not render it as
progress. **[live]**

**The `41` disambiguation.** State `41` is overloaded. The app reads
it as `HOTWATER_VOLUME` (slots 2/3) **only when window slot 6 is
`0xFF`**, and as `BYPASS_WATER_VOLUME` (slots 6/7) otherwise —
including when the payload is too short to contain slot 6. Slot 6 is
the bypass-water slot, so `0xFF` reads as "no bypass in this recipe,
the water figure is the real one".

The **bypass branch is confirmed on hardware**, and it was the shakier
half. In the captured `cafe_barista` (45 ml bypass) every `41` frame
had slot 6 ≠ `FF`; slots 6/7 climbed 0→9 while slots 2/3 sat frozen at
`9/9` from the finished water phase. Reading `HOTWATER_VOLUME` there
would have reported a dead 9/9 for the whole phase. **[live]**

Earlier revisions of this section said the opposite — that §5.9's live
frames showed the `HOTWATER_VOLUME` reading, "so on that firmware slot
6 was `0xFF`". That was a misattribution: payload bytes 4/5 do move,
but during state `3C`. **The `0xFF` / `HOTWATER_VOLUME` branch has
never been observed** and needs a product with no bypass (e.g.
`hotwater_portion`, `0x0D`).

#### Frame type

J.O.E. classifies each frame; the order is odd but deliberate and the
decoder mirrors it exactly:

1. state in {`C0`, `C1`, `C4`, `C5`} → `COFFEE_TIMER`;
2. state `7E` → `QUALITY_ASSISTANT`;
3. state ≠ `FE` **and** byte 1 is a known product code → `PRODUCT`;
4. byte 1 is a known process code → `PROCESS`;
5. state `FE` → `AROMA_PRESELECTION`;
6. state `FF` → `P_MODE`;
7. otherwise → `NONE`.

Rule 3 is **[live]**: all 32 frames of the captured brew resolved byte
1 `0x28` to `cafe_barista` against the EF1091 profile and classified as
`PRODUCT`. The other six rules are **[APK, untested]** — no process,
timer, aroma or P-mode frame has ever been seen on a wire.

"Known product code" means the loaded `MachineProfile` has it — so
this is profile-dependent: with no profile (or the wrong EF code) a
product frame classifies as `NONE`, while the value window still
decodes. "Known process code" is the tail of a `<PROCESS
ExecuteCommand="@TG:xx">` element; all 89 bundled XMLs use only
`21` CappuClean, `22` CoffeeRinse, `23` CappuRinse, `24` Cleaning,
`25` Decalc, `26` FilterChange, so `jura_connect.progress.PROCESS_CODES`
hard-codes those six.

```

Exactly four of these have been seen on a wire, all in the brew
capture: `39`, `3C`, `41`, `3E`, in that order. The remaining 83 are
**[APK, untested]** — a code this firmware family invented decodes to
`state = None` with the raw byte kept in `state_code`, never an
exception.

`3E` (`ENJOY`) ends a product. **[live]** It is a bare `@TV:3E<code>`
with no value window, and it is **level-triggered, not edge-triggered**:
the captured machine repeated it five times, ~2 s apart, until
something cleared the state ~10 s later. `is_complete` is therefore a
*state*, and a caller that counts brews or fires a notification on it
must act on the transition into `ENJOY`, or it acts once per repeat.
`JuraClient.follow_progress()` breaks on the first one; code driving
`iter_progress()` directly has to do this itself. The repeat count is
not a constant to rely on.

#### `@TV:` frames that are *not* progress

`@TV:81,<text>` and `@TV:82,<text>` are language-download display
lines and `@TV:84,<time>` is the coffee-timer clock sync. They must
never be fed to the progress decoder;
`jura_connect.progress.is_progress_frame()` rejects them (both the
comma-delimited form and any payload whose head byte is `81`/`82`/`84`)
and `ProductProgress.parse()` raises `ValueError` on them.

#### Library entry points

```python
p = ProductProgress.parse("@TV:41280000091E0000FF00000000003200", profile)
p.state          # ProgressState.HOTWATER_VOLUME (None for unknown codes)
p.progress_type  # ProgressType.PRODUCT
p.product        # "cafe_barista" — resolved via the MachineProfile
p.actual, p.maximum, p.percent, p.fraction
p.is_complete    # True only on the ENJOY frame
p.format(); p.to_dict()

for update in client.iter_progress(timeout=120):   # decoded stream
    ...
client.follow_progress(timeout=120)                 # collect until ENJOY
client.brew("espresso", follow=True)                # brew, then follow
```

The named `progress` command watches the stream and prints the decoded
lines; it is read-only (it sends nothing). The simulator models the
whole chain — `@tp` → `@TB` → rising `@TV:41…` frames → `@TV:3E…` —
behind `SimulatorConfig(allow_brew=True)`, which is off by default so
an accidental `@TP:` in a test still gets refused with `@an:error`.
That model is a simplification; the captured brew is available verbatim
as `simulator.CAPTURED_S8EB_CAFE_BARISTA_BREW` and can be pushed
instead via `SimulatorConfig(brew_script=…)`, which is what
`tests/test_progress_capture.py` replays through the full client stack.

#### Frame cadence during a brew **[live]**

The dongle's ~2.05 s `@TF:` broadcast **stops for the duration of the
product** and `@TV:` takes over the same slot: the capture has a 51.6 s
window with no `@TF:` frame at all, bracketed by `@TB` and the `@TS`
below. Anything using `@TF:` arrival as a liveness signal must tolerate
a ~1 minute gap per brew. The `@TV:` stream itself runs on the same
~2 s beat plus occasional extra frames as little as 0.13 s apart; most
of the extras carry a changed percentage, but not all of them do, so
"a new frame means something changed" is false.

### 5.11 Maintenance processes and the state machine — **APK/XML-derived, untested**

Starting a cleaning cycle is a conversation, not a command. `@TG:24`
only *opens* it; the machine then drives the client through its
`<STATE>` table and waits for confirmations. Everything in this section
comes from `WifiCommandStartProcess`, `WifiCommandProcessAccept`,
`WiFiCommandNextProductStep` and `StateArgument` in the decompiled app
plus the 89 bundled machine XMLs. **Nothing here has been run against
hardware** — every confirmation advances a real cycle and consumes
supplies, so it was verified against the simulator only.

#### The four verbs

| Wire | J.O.E. class | Reply matcher | Meaning |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| `@TG:21/22/23/24/25/26` | `WifiCommandStartProcess` | the command, lower-cased (`@tg:24`) | start the cycle |
| `@TG:10` / `@TG:04` | `WifiCommandProcessAccept` | *(none — the app awaits no reply)* | confirm the state the machine is parked on |
| `@TG:01` | `WiFiCommandNextProductStep` | `@tg:(01\|00)` | advance a step; `@tg:00` = rejected |
| `@TG:FF` | `WifiCommandCancelProductStep` | `@tg:FF` | cancel the current step (§5.8) |

`WifiCommandStartProcess` builds its matcher by lower-casing the
command it was handed, so the acknowledgement is a pure echo. The
accept command sets *no* matcher at all: the app fires it and moves on.
This library still waits for a frame (anything that is not a pushed
`@TF:`/`@TV:`), because a session that sends and never reads cannot tell
a refusal from a success.

#### `<PROCESSES>` — what a machine can run

```xml
<PROCESS Type="Cleaning" ExecuteCommand="@TG:24" Progress="true"
         Title="221" Picture="geraet_reinigen.png"
         PDFURL="…" VideoURL="…"/>
```

Six types exist across all 89 profiles, and each maps 1:1 onto a
command byte — the same table `jura_connect.progress.PROCESS_CODES`
uses to name the process byte of a `@TV:` frame:

| Type | Command | Profiles declaring it | Library name |
| ---- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `Cleaning` | `@TG:24` | 89 | `cleaning` |
| `Decalc` | `@TG:25` | 88 | `descale` |
| `FilterChange` | `@TG:26` | 83 | `filter_change` |
| `CappuRinse` | `@TG:23` | 75 | `cappu_rinse` |
| `CappuClean` | `@TG:21` | 74 | `cappu_clean` |
| `CoffeeRinse` | `@TG:22` | 3 | `coffee_rinse` |

`Progress="true"` means the machine pushes `@TV:` frames while the
cycle runs. Every `Cleaning`, `Decalc`, `CappuRinse`, `CappuClean` and
`CoffeeRinse` entry declares it; `FilterChange` declares
`Progress="false"` on 78 of the 83 profiles that have it — those
machines run the filter change entirely on their own front panel, so
following one from here will see no states and simply time out.
`MachineProcess.progress` carries the flag.

#### `<PROGRESS_STATE_INTAKE>` — the state table

83 `<STATE>` entries, identical in value and name across every bundled
profile:

```xml
<STATE Value="26" Name="Press Rinse" Title="193"
       Picture="pflege_druecken.png" AcceptCommand="@TG:10"/>
```

`Value` is **the same byte as `ProgressState`** (§5.10), i.e. the first
byte of a pushed `@TV:` frame, so the frame resolves straight into the
machine's own label for the step.

The XML table is not redundant with the enum: **18 of EF1091's 83
states are missing from `ProgressState` entirely** — among them `22`
"Press Rotary or Next", `24` "Coffee Ready", `2D` "No milk", `9B` "Dock
Cappu Outlet" and, crucially, **`26` "Press Rinse", the state a
cleaning cycle parks on**. Without the profile the decoder reports that
frame as `UNKNOWN(0x26)` and nothing knows a confirmation is due. Load
the machine profile.

Only four states ever carry an `AcceptCommand`:

| State | Name | Accept | Profiles |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | -------- |
| `26` | Press Rinse | `@TG:10` | 78 |
| `92` | Cappu Clean add cleaner | `@TG:04` | 10 |
| `94` | Cappu Clean add water | `@TG:04` | 10 |
| `75` | Cleaning add tablet | `@TG:10` | 9 |

So a profile uses `@TG:10`, `@TG:04`, or both — never anything else
(pinned by a test over all 89 XMLs). Five states end a cycle, again
identically everywhere: `0B` Cappurinse finished, `56` Descale
finished, `65` Filter Rinse finished, `76` Cleaning Process finished,
`95` Cappu Clean finish. `jura_connect.process.PROCESS_FINISH_STATES`
maps each process to its own; `TERMINAL_STATE_CODES` is the union plus
`3E` (`ENJOY`).

#### The conversation

```
-> @TG:24
<- @tg:24
<- @TV:7024…            state 70  "Cleaning Start"
<- @TV:7224…            state 72  "Cleaning empty tray"
<- @TV:7524…            state 75  "Cleaning add tablet"
<- @TV:2624…            state 26  "Press Rinse"  -> AcceptCommand="@TG:10"
-> @TG:10
<- @tg:10
<- @TV:7424…            state 74  "Cleaning Process"
<- @TV:7624…            state 76  "Cleaning Process finished"
```

The frames are ordinary progress frames (§5.10): byte 0 the state, byte
1 the **process** code, then the value window — which is why
`ProductProgress.progress_type` comes out as `PROCESS`. No bundled
profile assigns a product the codes `0x21`..`0x26`, so a process frame
can never be mistaken for a product one.

The *ordering* of the states inside a cycle is the one thing the XMLs
do not say. The sequences in `SimulatorConfig.process_sequences` are a
plausible reconstruction, not an observation.

#### Alert metadata: what is blocked, and what clears it

The same XML says which products an active alert stops and which
process makes it go away:

```xml
<ALERT Bit="10" Name="no beans" … Blocked="C" Type="info"/>
<ALERT Bit="34" Name="cleaning alert" … Type="ip"
       ProcessButton="206" Process="Cleaning" CancelButton="72"/>
```

* `Type="block"` blocks **every** product kind; `info` / `ip` block only
  what `Blocked` names (and `Blocked` is absent on most of them).
* `Blocked` is a single `Product.ProductGroup` token — `C`, `M`, `CM`,
  `T`, `TM`, `P`. Jura's own comment only says that `CM` "block[s]
  products of Coffe, Milk and Coffe + Milk", and the app code that
  consumes the field did not survive obfuscation, so
  `profile.expand_blocked_kinds()` implements the reading that matches
  that example and the machine's behaviour: **a token blocks every kind
  that shares a letter with it**. `Blocked="M"` therefore blocks `M`,
  `CM` and `TM` — no milk, no cappuccino.
* `Process` names the maintenance process that clears the alert, in the
  same vocabulary as the table above (`Decalc` → `descale`).
  **13 of the 89 profiles point at a process they never declare** —
  milk-free machines that kept the boilerplate cappu-rinse/cappu-clean
  alerts. Treat the field as a hint; `resolve_process()` refuses an
  undeclared one rather than sending a verb the machine has no use for.
* `Disabled="0406070A2E"` is a list of individual product codes (the app
  chops it into two-character substrings); watch-only in J.O.E.

`MachineStatus` surfaces all of this **only when a profile is loaded** —
the hard-coded EF536 fallback codebook has no such metadata:

```python
st = client.read_status()          # client built with profile=load_profile("EF1091")
st.blocked_kinds                   # ("C", "CM") — no beans
st.blocked_products                # ("espresso", "coffee", "cappuccino", …)
st.blocking_alerts                 # ("no_beans",)
st.alert_processes                 # (("cleaning_alert", "cleaning"),)
st.can_brew_kind("T")              # True — hot water is still fine
st.can_brew("espresso")            # False
```

Every pre-existing field and `to_dict()` key is unchanged; the four new
keys (`blocked_kinds`, `blocked_products`, `blocking_alerts`,
`alert_processes`) are additive.

#### Library entry points

```python
client.process_runner("cleaning")      # bind, send nothing
client.run_process("cleaning", auto_accept=True, timeout=900)
client.watch_process(timeout=60)       # read-only: decode a cycle someone else started

runner = client.process_runner("cleaning")
runner.start()                         # @TG:24, raises ProcessError if refused
step = runner.wait_step(timeout=120)   # ProcessStep: name, accept_command, percent
if step.needs_confirmation:
    runner.accept()                    # the state's own @TG:10 / @TG:04
runner.next_step(); runner.cancel()    # @TG:01 / @TG:FF
run = runner.follow(auto_accept=True)  # ProcessRun.format() / .to_dict()
```

`follow(on_step=…)` takes a decision callback returning a
`ProcessAction` (`WAIT` / `ACCEPT` / `NEXT` / `CANCEL`), which is how a
UI drives the cycle without blocking on `auto_accept`.

Named commands: `processes` (list, no I/O) and `process-watch`
(listen-only) are ungated; `process-start`, `process-run`,
`process-accept` and `process-next` are **gated** — `@TG:01`, `@TG:04`
and `@TG:10` joined `DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES` because confirming a step
advances a physical cycle and burns the tablet or descaler that step
uses. The simulator models the whole walk behind
`SimulatorConfig(allow_process=True)` and refuses the verbs with
`@an:error` without it.

### 5.12 Coffee timer (`@TM:3C` + `@TV:84`) — APK-derived, untested

**Nothing in this section has been seen on a real machine.** It is
read straight out of the J.O.E. APK (`WifiCommandStartCoffeeTimer`,
`WifiSendTimeForCoffeeTimer`), cross-checked byte for byte against the
Bluetooth adapter (`CoffeeMachineAdapterBle2.addCoffeeTimerCommand` /
`.sendTimeForCoffeeTimer`, whose method names survived obfuscation),
and verified only against the in-tree simulator.

The coffee timer makes the machine brew **later, on its own**. Two
frames, in this order:

```
-> @TM:3C,<blob:40 hex><delay:4 hex><csum:2 hex>     schedule
<- @tm:…                                             matcher "@tm:.*"

-> @TV:84,<"HH:MM" hex-encoded>                      wall clock
<- @tv:84
```

#### The schedule frame

```java
// WifiCommandStartCoffeeTimer
String strO = f.o("3C,", StringsKt.V(40, appProduct.c(data) + StringsKt.H(20, "00")),
                  ExtensionsKt.e(seconds));
super(priority, f.o("@TM:", strO, ByteOperations.d(strO)), …);
f("@tm:.*");
```

* **`appProduct.c(data)` is the very same builder `@TP:` uses** —
  `WifiCommandStartProduct` is `"@TP:".concat(appProduct.c(data))`. So
  the payload is the 16-byte recipe blob of §5.9, unchanged:
  `ProductDef.build_recipe_hex()`.
* `StringsKt.H(20, "00")` is `"00".repeat(20)`, `StringsKt.V(40, s)` is
  `s.take(40)` (both verified in the decompiled `kotlin/text/StringsKt`).
  Net effect: **right-pad the 32-hex blob with `"00"` to 40 hex chars**
  (20 bytes), truncating anything longer. The four extra bytes are
  always zero for every bundled product — no product's blob is longer
  than 16 bytes.
* `ExtensionsKt.e(int)` is `String.format("%04X", i & 0xFFFF)` — a
  **16-bit big-endian field, four upper-case hex chars**.
* The trailing byte is the ordinary `@TM:` write checksum
  (`ByteOperations.d`, `client._settings_checksum`) computed over
  `"3C," + blob + delay` — the argument and its comma are *inside* the
  checksummed string, exactly like a settings write.
* Unlike a settings write, J.O.E. does **not** wrap this in the
  `@TS:01` / `@TS:00` keypad lock — the command goes out on the
  `PMODE`-class priority channel on its own.

Worked example (EF1091 espresso, 90 minutes out):

```
@TM:3C,02000809000002000100000000000000000000001518F8
       └────────────── 32 hex: the @TP: recipe blob ──┘└──────┘└──┘└┘
                                                          │     │   └ checksum
                                                          │     └ delay 0x1518 = 5400 s
                                                          └ 8 hex of "00" padding
```

#### What the integer means

`ExtensionsKt.e()`'s argument is **seconds until the brew starts**, not
a slot index and not a weekday bitmap. Established from
`CoffeeTimerViewModel$startCoffeeTimerProduct` and the edit screen's
"set" handler (`n3/m0.java`), which compute it as:

```java
long delta = target.getTimeInMillis() - now.getTimeInMillis();   // sec/ms zeroed
if (delta < 0) delta += 86400000;                                // roll to tomorrow
stateFlow.setValue((int) (delta / 60000) * 60);                  // whole minutes × 60
```

so the value on the wire is always a **multiple of 60**. The same
screen refuses to send at all outside `60000 ms … 57600000 ms`, i.e.
**1 minute to 16 hours** — comfortably inside the 16-bit field
(57600 = `0xE100`).

What is *not* established: whether the machine reads the field as
seconds or merely as "delay units that J.O.E. happens to fill with
seconds". Every observed value is a multiple of 60, so a
minutes-scaled firmware reading would be indistinguishable from the
app's traffic alone. `jura-connect` sends what the app sends.

#### The wall-clock frame

```java
// WifiSendTimeForCoffeeTimer
super(priority, "@TV:84,".concat(ExtensionsKt.c(time)), …);
f("@tv:84");
```

`ExtensionsKt.c(String)` hex-encodes **each character** as `%02X` — the
same encoding the handshake uses for the connection id (§4.1). The
string J.O.E. passes is `String.format("%02d:%02d", HOUR_OF_DAY,
MINUTE)` of the **target** time, so `07:30` goes out as:

```
@TV:84,30373A3330        ("0"=30 "7"=37 ":"=3A "3"=33 "0"=30)
```

Two things worth being explicit about:

* **J.O.E. sends this *after* the schedule, not before.** The order in
  `startCoffeeTimerProduct` is `addCoffeeTimerCommand(...)` then
  `sendTimeForCoffeeTimer(...)`. It is therefore *not* a prerequisite
  clock sync — the countdown is carried by the `@TM:3C` delay field.
* **The value is the target time, not the current time.** Whether the
  machine uses it to set its own clock or only to render "ready at
  07:30" on its display is **unknown**; nothing in the app reads a
  clock back. It carries no checksum.

`JuraClient.schedule_brew()` mirrors the app's order and skips the
clock frame when the schedule was refused, so a firmware that doesn't
implement the timer can't leave the caller blocked on a reply that
never comes.

#### Rejection tokens

The matcher is the permissive `@tm:.*`, so the short `@TM:`-family
rejections come back through the same door as a success and must not
be read as one. `jura-connect` treats `@tm:00` (rejected) and
`@tm:C2` ("product code, slot or function not supported by machine",
§5.6) as failures, and anything else beginning `@tm:` as an accept.
An `@an:error` is a failure too. This mirrors §5.9's `@tp` vs
`@tp:00` lesson: a reply that *matches* is not a reply that *worked*.

#### Which products may be scheduled

`<PRODUCT … Coffeetimer="true|false">` marks eligibility. Only five of
the 89 bundled profiles carry the attribute at all (EF1115, EF1115V2,
EF1119, EF1121, EF1139); on every other machine — EF1091 included —
it is simply absent. J.O.E.'s
`Product` model stores it as a **nullable** Boolean and defaults a
missing one to true:

```java
this.shouldBeShownInCoffeeTimer = bool != null ? bool.booleanValue() : true;
```

`ProductDef.coffee_timer` follows that rule exactly: only an explicit
`Coffeetimer="false"` makes a product ineligible, and
`schedule_brew()` refuses those client-side before anything reaches
the wire. EF1121 is the interesting profile — it marks eight of its
products (Americano, Lungo, Espresso doppio, all four milk drinks,
Hot water) ineligible while leaving Espresso and Coffee schedulable.

Two machines (EF1106, EF1119) additionally declare
`<CAPABILITIES CoffeeTimerGrinderFreenessSetting="false"/>`, which
gates whether the coffee-timer screen offers the grinder-freeness
parameter (`Argument="F17"`). `jura-connect` never sets F17, so the
capability is recorded here for completeness and not acted upon.

#### Progress states

While a timer is pending, the machine reports it through the
`COFFEE_TIMER` family of progress states (`C0` screen saver, `C1`
status screen, `C4` coffee timer, `C5` PMode countdown) already
decoded in `jura_connect/progress.py`.

#### Safety

`@TM:3C,` is in `commands.DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES` — **with the trailing
comma**. The tuple is byte-prefix matched and the `@TM:` space is
shared with ordinary register reads, so listing the bare `@TM:3C`
would also gate a harmless `mem-read 3C`. Settings and PMode writes
stay out of the tuple entirely (they are gated per-command via
`dynamic_danger`); the coffee timer is listed because, unlike them, it
can make the machine physically pour.

The simulator refuses `@TM:3C,` with `@an:error` like every other
destructive frame; `SimulatorConfig(coffee_timer=True)` opts a test
into the modelled wire path, and `coffee_timer_reject=True` models a
firmware that answers the `@tm:00` rejection instead. The accept reply
the simulator gives (`@tm:3c`) is **modelled, not observed** — it
follows the echo-the-argument convention of every other `@TM:` write.

There is no dedicated cancel command. J.O.E.'s
`CoffeeTimerViewModel.cancelCoffeeTimer` sends
`CoffeeMachineAdapter.cancelProductStep()` — plain **`@TG:FF`**, the
generic "cancel the current product step" frame — and then clears its
own room database. `@TG:FF` is the `cancel` command here — it is
deliberately *not* in `DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES` (see §5.8: it aborts a
step rather than resetting anything), so `cancel` reaches it without
the gate. Whether it actually clears a *pending* timer (as opposed to
aborting a running brew) is untested.

### 5.13 Preselections (`<PRESELECTION>` / `<COMBINATION>`) — **APK-derived, unverified**

> **Nothing in this section has been seen on a wire.** It is a
> transcription of the J.O.E. Android APK, cross-checked between jadx
> output and smali, plus what the machine XMLs declare. No hardware was
> available when it was written. Treat every byte as a hypothesis:
> a wrong one misbrews. Verify before trusting.

#### What the XML declares

Each `<PRODUCT>` carries a `<PRESELECTION>` child listing the toggles
that product supports, and the machine as a whole carries an optional
`<MULTIPLE_PRESELECTS>` block listing which toggles may be active *at
the same time*:

```xml
<PRESELECTION xtrashot="false" double="31" powder="true" coldbrew="false" sweetfoam="false"/>
...
<MULTIPLE_PRESELECTS>
  <COMBINATION powder="true" sweetfoam="true"/>
  <COMBINATION xtrashot="true" sweetfoam="true"/>
</MULTIPLE_PRESELECTS>
```

Every attribute is a plain `"true"`/`"false"` flag **except `double`**,
which carries the **product code of the double product** (or `"00"`).
Jura's own comment in the documented template profile
(`data/xml/EF0000/3.8.xml`) says so:

> All preselections are either true or false - except the double. The
> double preselect contains the Product Code of the Double Product (old
> T-Protocol) or just 00 for the new T-Protocol with F18 support
> (`<CAPABILITIES IntakeF18="true"/>` in the MACHINEMANIFEST). If the
> double contains a Product Code other than 00, the Product should
> exist in this List of Products too […]

Observed across the 89 bundled profiles:

* attribute names: `xtrashot`, `double`, `powder`, `coldbrew`,
  `strongcoldbrew`, `lightbrew`, `sweetfoam`, `fakesweetfoam`,
  `chocolate`, `XL`, `PModeAdjust`. The last is never `"true"`
  anywhere;
* `double` values: `00` plus the codes `11`–`1D`, `29`, `31`, `36`,
  `38`, `39`, `3B`, `3E`, `3F`. All resolve to a product in the same
  catalogue **except** EF1143's Espresso Doppio (`0x30` → `0x31`,
  which that XML never defines);
* `double="00"` is read here as **"no double"**. Jura's comment allows
  it to also mean "double via F18" on new-protocol machines, but every
  bundled XML that writes `00` does so for products that cannot
  sensibly be doubled (milk foam, hot water, pot) — *including*
  `IntakeF18` machines, which also still write real double codes. So
  `00` is not treated as an F18 opt-in;
* 17 profiles declare `<COMBINATION>` rows; the other 72 allow no
  simultaneous preselections at all. Two rows are written with a
  `"false"` attribute (`<COMBINATION powder="false" sweetfoam="true"/>`
  in EF1123) — only the `"true"` attributes are read as members, which
  degenerates those rows to a single preselection, i.e. no information.

#### How the app encodes them

Single encoder for both WiFi and BLE:
`ch.toptronic.joe.model.product.AppProduct.c(ProductStartData)`
(jadx lines 151-184; smali `AppProduct.smali:400-806` agrees).
`WifiCommandStartProduct` builds `"@TP:" + AppProduct.c(startData)`.
Paraphrased:

```java
ArrayList blob = chunk(2, d());        // d() = 17 entries of "00",
blob.set(8, "01");                     //   each recipe param at F-1
blob.set(0, doubleCode-or-productCode);
blob.set(15, grinderInstructions ? "04" : "00");
if (product.hasAnyPreselection() && !startData.f18Enabled)
    for (PreselectArgument p : selected)
        if (p.index != null) blob.set(p.index, p.value);   // legacy overwrite
boolean hasF17 = params.containsKey("F17") || params.containsKey("F17_H");
String s = join(blob).substring(0, (hasF17 ? 17 : 16) * 2);
if (!startData.f18Enabled) return s;                       // 16 or 17 bytes
int mask = Σ bit(p) for p in selected;
return hasF17 ? s + "0000" + hex(mask) : s + "000000" + hex(mask);  // 20 bytes
```

`f18Enabled` is `CMCapabilities.intakeF18Enabled`, parsed from
`<CAPABILITIES IntakeF18="…"/>` (`XMLParser.smali:1132`). It defaults
to **false**, and 23 of the 89 bundled profiles set it. **EF1091 (the
S8 EB) has no manifest at all**, so the maintainer's machine is on the
legacy path and *cannot* exercise the mask path.

##### Old T-protocol: product-code swap + byte overwrites

`AppProduct.c` lines 156-161 substitute the double product's code into
blob byte 0 — only when `double` is selected, the XML gives a non-empty
code, **and** the machine is not `IntakeF18`. The remaining
preselections come from the `(index, value)` payloads of the
`PreselectArgument` enum
(`shared_model/interfaces/PreselectArgument.java:76-96`) and are written
**after** the recipe parameters, overwriting them:

| preselection | blob offset | value | note |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| `powder`    | 2 (F3)  | `00` | blanks coffee strength — the grinder is skipped |
| `coldbrew`  | 6 (F7)  | `80` | out-of-band temperature value |
| `lightbrew` | 6 (F7)  | `81` | out-of-band temperature value |
| `xtrashot`  | 7 (F8)  | `02` | stroke byte |
| `double`    | 0       | double product code | from the XML |
| `sweetfoam`, `fakesweetfoam`, `strongcoldbrew` | — | — | **no payload: J.O.E. sends nothing for these on such a machine** |

That last row is not an omission on our side: those enum entries carry
`null` for both index and value, and there is no other code path. The
app will happily show a sweet-foam toggle on an S8 EB and then start a
plain cappuccino. `jura-connect` refuses them instead.

Note the collisions that follow: `powder` contradicts an explicit
strength, `coldbrew`/`lightbrew` contradict an explicit temperature.
`build_recipe_hex` raises rather than silently dropping the caller's
value.

##### `IntakeF18`: one appended mask byte

When `f18Enabled` is set, the legacy overwrites **and** the double
product-code swap are both skipped, and a single mask byte is appended.
The bits are a hardcoded table in `AppProduct.c`:

| preselection | bit |
| ------------ | --- |
| `powder`          | `0x01` |
| `xtrashot`        | `0x02` |
| `sweetfoam`       | `0x04` |
| `lightbrew`       | `0x08` |
| `coldbrew`        | `0x10` |
| `double`          | `0x40` |
| `strongcoldbrew`  | `0x80` |
| `fakesweetfoam`   | *(none — absent from the table)* |

`0x20` is unused. The blob is padded so the mask is always the **20th
byte, offset 19** — `"0000"` of padding when the product has an F17
grinder-freeness parameter (which occupies offset 16), `"000000"`
otherwise.

Beware two decoy bitmasks in the same APK:
`ch/toptronic/joe/model/enums/PreselectType` has a *different* mask
(powder 8, double 4, extra-shot 2, light-brew 128, sweet-foam 16,
fake-sweet-foam 32, cold-brew 1, strong-cold-brew 256) used for UI /
stored state, and the `PreselectArgument` enum's own ordinals are not a
mask at all.

#### Open questions

* **Why "F18" when the byte lands at offset 19 (i.e. F20)?** No XML
  declares `Argument="F18"`, `F19` or `F20`, and the string `"F18"`
  appears nowhere in the smali outside the capability name. Either the
  name is historical or the machine numbers this blob differently.
  Unresolved.
* Whether the pad bytes must be `00` — the app never varies them.
* Whether an `IntakeF18` machine also **requires** the 20-byte form for
  a plain, preselection-free brew. J.O.E. always sends 20 bytes to such
  a machine; `jura-connect` keeps sending the verified 16-byte blob
  unless a preselection is requested, because no 20-byte blob has ever
  been confirmed to brew. If a preselection-free `@TP:` is ACKed
  `@tp:00` on an `IntakeF18` machine, the 20-byte form is the first
  thing to try.
* Whether `sweetfoam` really is a no-op on old machines, or reaches
  them by some path outside `AppProduct.c` (a separate product code —
  EF1091 does carry a distinct "Sweet Latte" at `0x2C` — or a machine
  setting).
* Nothing here says what the *machine* does with an unknown
  preselection bit. Assume the worst.

#### What `jura-connect` does with it

`brew <product> <preselection>…` (bare words, e.g.
`brew espresso double`, `brew cappuccino extra_shot`) validates in this
order, all before anything reaches the wire:

1. the name is a known preselection (aliases: `extra_shot`,
   `cold_brew`, `light_brew`, `sweet_foam`, …);
2. the product's `<PRESELECTION>` element declares it;
3. the requested set fits inside one `<COMBINATION>` row (a subset of a
   legal row is legal; a single preselection always is);
4. this machine generation can actually express it — otherwise it is
   refused, never silently dropped.

`products` lists each product's preselections and flags the ones the
connected machine cannot send, so it never advertises something `brew`
will reject. `MachineProfile.plan_preselections()` is the library entry
point and returns a `PreselectionPlan` (which product to brew, the mask
byte, the byte overwrites). `brew … mask=<hex>` forces the mask byte
verbatim for firmware that numbers the bits differently.

### 5.14 Language download (`@TS:F1` / `@TT:xx` / `@TV:8x`)

**APK-derived; only the "machine does not support it" path has been
seen.** Every byte below comes from the J.O.E. 4.6.10 APK — the
`WifiCommand*` classes under `connection/command/language_download/`,
their `parser/language_download/` counterparts, and
`CoffeeMachineAdapter.downloadLanguage` (readable only in smali; jadx
bails out of the coroutine body). `jura_connect.language` implements it
and `jura_connect.simulator` models it.

The one hardware datapoint is a *negative* one: an S8 EB / EF1091,
which declares no download capability, ignores `@TT:00` completely and
answers `@TM:23` with `@tm:A3` = `NOT_SUPPORTED` ([capture
§4](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)) — see "A machine without
the language verbs stays silent" below. That is the *absence* path.
No machine has ever been asked to swallow a language image, and no
populated `@tt:00` inventory reply has ever been seen, so treat the
transfer half of this section as a hypothesis until someone verifies it
on a machine that declares the capability.

#### Capability gating

Only machines whose XML carries a `<MACHINEMANIFEST>` can do this:

```xml
<CAPABILITIES IntakeF18="true" LanguageDownload="true"
              BinaryLanguageDownload="true" LanguageDownloadBlock="0B"/>
```

Six of the 89 bundled profiles declare `LanguageDownload="true"`:
`EF0000` (the documented template), `EF1106`, `EF1123`, `EF1125`,
`EF1171`, `EF1208`. `EF1091` (the maintainer's S8 EB) has no manifest
at all, so the feature is refused there before anything reaches the
wire. Attribute semantics, mirroring the APK's `CMCapabilities`:

| Attribute | Meaning | Default when absent |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| `LanguageDownload` | feature exists at all | `false` |
| `BinaryLanguageDownload` | use `@TT:08` instead of `@TT:02` | **`true`** |
| `LanguageDownloadBlock` | slot the download overwrites (hex) | `"0B"` |

`MachineProfile.capabilities` parses these
(`jura_connect.profile.MachineCapabilities`); the block doubles as the
index into the `@TT:00` list, which is how J.O.E.'s
`getDownloadedLanguage()` shows what is currently installed.

#### Commands

| Wire | Reply regex | Meaning |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `@TS:F1` | `@ts` | lock the keypad for the download |
| `@TS:00` | `@ts` | release it (same verb as the display unlock) |
| `@TM:23` | `@tm:23` / `@tm:23,0C<xx>` / `@tm:A3` / `@tm:00` | max-languages probe |
| `@TT:00` | `@tt:00(,[0-9A-F]{6})+` | slot inventory |
| `@TT:01,<block>` | `@tt:01,[0-9A-F]{2}` | select the slot to overwrite |
| `@TT:02,<addr8><data>` | `@tt:02,[A-F]{2}(,[0-9A-F]{4})?` | ASCII record transfer |
| `@TT:08,<binary>` | `@tt:08,[A-F]{2}(,[0-9A-F]{4})?` | binary record transfer |
| `@TT:03` | `@tt:03,[A-F]{2}(,[0-9A-F]{4})?` | finish the block |
| `@TV:81,<text><csum>` | `@tv:81` | display line 1 |
| `@TV:82,<text><csum>` | `@tv:82` | display line 2 |

`@TM:23` and `@TT:00` are reads; everything else in this table mutates
the machine and is in `DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES` verb by verb (the tuple is
prefix-matched, so `@TT:00` must not be gated by a blanket `@TT:`).

Status bytes, from the parser classes:

| Byte | `@tt:01` select | `@tt:02` / `@tt:08` transfer | `@tt:03` finish |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| `FF` | success | success | success |
| `FE` | block not available | write error | CRC not matching |
| `FD` | — | wrong syntax | — |
| `FC` | execution in progress | wrong length | — |
| `FB` | wrong content | wrong content | — |
| `FA` | — | wrong logic | — |

`@TM:23` decodes as `@tm:23` → supported, `@tm:23,0C<xx>` → a language
is already set, `@tm:A3` → not supported, `@tm:00` → checksum false.
(J.O.E.'s own parser tests the bare `@tm:23` pattern first with a
*substring* match, so its `LANGUAGE_SET` branch is unreachable; we check
the longer form first, which is evidently what was meant.)

The `@tt:00` inventory is a list of 6-hex-char groups: 2 chars of slot
index followed by 2 ASCII bytes of language code, with `FFFF` marking an
empty slot. J.O.E. reads 14 slots (0..13).

#### A machine without the language verbs stays silent — **verified**

Kaffeebert (S8 EB / EF1091, TT237W, 2026-08-16 —
[capture §4](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)) does **not**
reject `@TT:00` with a token. It sends **nothing at all**, while
continuing its ~2 s `@TF:` broadcast, until the read times out.
Reproduced three times over 10 s and 15 s windows.

`@TM:23` on the same machine answers `@tm:A3` → `NOT_SUPPORTED`
(consistent with the `addr | 0x80` rule in §5.7, and with EF1091
carrying no `<MACHINEMANIFEST><CAPABILITIES>` at all).

So the pair splits cleanly: **`@TM:23` tells you whether the machine
knows about language slots; `@TT:00` tells you nothing on a machine
that doesn't.** `language.read_inventory` therefore records the
`@TT:00` timeout in `LanguageInventory.list_error` and still issues
`@TM:23`, rather than letting the `TimeoutError` escape — a read-only
introspection command has to survive the machine it is introspecting.
The simulator models the silent machine whenever
`allow_language_download` is off, which is what pins the behaviour
(`tests/test_language_download.py::test_language_inventory_survives_a_machine_that_ignores_tt00`).

#### The 16-bit field on success — unknown

A successful transfer or finish answers `@tt:0x,FF,<4 hex>`; the error
codes carry no such field. J.O.E. never looks at it: every parser only
switches on the status byte. Since `@TT:03` can fail with
`FE = COMMON_ERROR_CRC_NOT_MATCHING`, the reading that fits is a
**running CRC the machine keeps over the selected block**, echoed back
so the app could verify it. Other candidates (bytes remaining, next
expected address) are not ruled out. `jura_connect` surfaces the field
and interprets nothing; the simulator answers a CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over
the bytes it has accepted so far, purely so the shape is exercised.

#### Payload format

Jura's language images are Motorola S-records. J.O.E. parses each line
by dropping the first 4 characters (`S3` + length byte) and the last 2
(the record checksum), then splits the remainder into an 8-hex-char
address and up to 128 hex chars of data — i.e. **`S3` records with
64-byte payloads**. `jura_connect.language.LanguagePayload.from_srec`
parses the same files properly (`S1`/`S2`/`S3`, checksum verified,
`S0`/`S5`/`S7`/`S8`/`S9` skipped); `from_bytes` covers callers that hold
a flat image plus its base address.

For the **binary** transfer J.O.E. merges pairs of adjacent records
(`addr[i] + 0x40 == addr[i+1]`) into single 128-byte writes.
`LanguagePayload.merged()` does the same, generalised to "the next
record starts exactly where this one ends, and both fit in 128 bytes".

#### Record encoding

ASCII (`@TT:02`) is plain text:

```
@TT:02,<address:8 hex><data hex>          # no length field
```

Binary (`@TT:08`) is a *raw byte* command — `WifiCommand` is constructed
with `binaryData=true`, so its body is emitted as bytes rather than
ASCII:

```
"@TT:08," <esc(address:4)> <esc(length:2)> <esc(data)>
```

where `esc()` replaces each `0x00`, `0x0A`, `0x0D` and `0x1B` with
`0x1B <byte + 0x80>` (`CoffeeMachineAdapterBle2.Companion.a`). This
escaping is a **separate layer** from the transport's reserved-byte
escaping in §1.2/§2.4 — the machine's line parser would otherwise choke
on an embedded CR/LF or NUL. `length` is the data byte count, so unlike
`@TT:02` the binary form is self-delimiting.

Display lines carry their own checksum: `@TV:81,<text><csum>` where
`csum` is the low byte of the sum of the text's characters, two hex
chars (`ByteOperations.e`). Note this is **not** the `ByteOperations.d`
checksum the `@TM:` setting writes use (§5.7) — different function, same
family. Both lines are truncated to 19 characters.

#### Sequence

```
@TV:81,<line1><csum>     optional: paint the machine display
@TV:82,<line2><csum>
@TS:F1                   lock the keypad for the whole download
@TT:00                   read the slot inventory
@TM:23                   support probe
@TT:01,<block>           select the slot to overwrite
@TT:02,<addr><data>      one per record, 80 ms apart in J.O.E.
   …
@TT:03                   finish; the machine verifies its checksum
@TS:00                   release the keypad
@TV:81,' ' @TV:82,' '    blank the display lines
```

Error handling, as implemented in `CoffeeMachineAdapter`:

* Any `@TT:01` failure → J.O.E. sends `@TT:03` first (its
  `downloadLanguage` calls `finishLanguageDownload` before it even
  inspects the status byte), closing whatever session the machine
  thinks is open. Only then does it look at the code: `FC` (execution
  in progress) retries the select **once**, anything else gives up.
  `jura_connect` mirrors both halves (`select_retries=1`).
* A refused record aborts the transfer immediately; `@TT:03` is **not**
  sent, and the run ends with `@TS:00` only. `jura_connect` releases the
  lock from a `finally`, because a leaked `@TS:F1` leaves the display
  locked until a power cycle (§9).
* J.O.E. continues into the transfer after a *non*-`FC` select failure
  (its `selectLanguageBlock failed:` branch falls through). That looks
  like an oversight; `jura_connect` aborts instead.

After a **successful** download J.O.E. additionally writes several PMode
entries — `@TM:24` (a packed download date built by
`LanguageDownloadHelper`, plus the language code taken from the file
name), `@TM:25,01`, `@TM:09,FF` (language setting = "the downloaded
one"), `@TM:22` and `@TM:23,0C`. `jura_connect` does **not** write
these: they are app-level bookkeeping we cannot verify, and `@TM:09` is
already reachable through the ordinary settings API (§5.7). A machine
may therefore hold the new image without switching to it.

#### What this library does *not* do

Fetching the language blobs. J.O.E. downloads them from Jura's CDN over
HTTPS (`ServerDocumentsRepository`); `jura-connect` takes whatever bytes
the caller supplies and pushes them. No network dependency was added.

### 5.15 Firmware OTA, dongle restart and the milk cooler

> **⚠ Danger — this section describes the only commands in the protocol
> that can permanently destroy the WiFi dongle.** The OTA verbs
> overwrite the Smart Connect's own firmware. An interrupted transfer, a
> mismatched image or a restart issued while the dongle sits in
> bootloader mode leaves it with no working application firmware, and
> there is **no remote recovery** — the machine's WiFi is gone until the
> dongle is physically serviced or replaced.
>
> **Nothing in this section has ever been run against hardware by this
> project, except the read-only `@HU?` status** (`@hu:800` = no cooler,
> [capture §5](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md); see below).
> Every other byte below is read out of the J.O.E. Android APK
> (`WifiCommandBootloaderMode`, `WifiCommandSendApplicationDat`,
> `WifiCommandSendApplicationBin`, `WifiCommandOTAEnd`,
> `WifiCommandRestartFrog`, `WifiCommandMilkCoolerUpdateStart` /
> `…Status`, plus `CoffeeMachineAdapterWifi.sendFrogToBootloader` for
> the ordering). **APK-derived, untested.** Do not probe it to find out.

#### Wire forms

| Send | Reply (J.O.E. matcher) | Meaning |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| `@HB` | `@hb(:(abort\|ok))?` | enter bootloader; only `@hb:ok` is a go-ahead — `@hb:abort` and a bare `@hb` both mean "declined" |
| `@HO:<hex>` | `@ho:((ok)\|(error))` | the DFU `.dat` init packet, hex-encoded ASCII |
| `@HD:<offset:08X><len:04X><hex>` | `@hd:((error)\|(.*))` | one application-image window; anything that is not the literal `error` counts as an ack |
| `@HE` | `@he:((ok)\|(error))` | end of transfer — this is what makes the dongle apply the image |
| `@HT:3` | `((@ht))` | restart the dongle ("frog"); the session dies with it |
| `@HU` | `@hu:((abort)\|(wait)\|(busy)\|(ok)\|(error))` | start a milk-cooler (Cool Control) firmware update |
| `@HU?` | `@hu:[0-9a-fA-F]{3}` | milk-cooler update state — **read-only** |

Offsets and lengths in `@HD:` are ASCII **text**, not packed bytes:
`ByteOperations.h(value, width)` formats `%0<width>X` and then takes the
characters' byte values. Both payload commands run through the plain
(non-binary) `WifiCommand` path, so the whole frame is printable ASCII
terminated by `\r\n` inside the cipher like every other command.

#### Sequence

`CoffeeMachineAdapterWifi.sendFrogToBootloader` builds the entire chain
up front and links it through `WifiCommand.next`, then sends `@HB` and
lets each reply pull the next command:

```
@HB                       -> @hb:ok
@HO:<dat hex>             -> @ho:ok
@HD:00000000 0200 <512 B> -> @hd:…      offset 0, first window
@HD:00000200 0200 <512 B> -> @hd:…      offset += previous chunk length
…
@HE                       -> @he:ok
(@HT:3                    -> @ht)       optional, only after a clean @he:ok
```

* Chunk size is **512 bytes** (`chunked(0x200)` in the app).
* The offset is a running byte offset into the `.bin`, the packet
  counter is 1-based, and the app derives its progress percentage from
  `packetCounter / totalPackets`.
* `.dat` always precedes the `.bin` windows: it is the head of the
  command chain, the windows hang off it.
* J.O.E. allows 30 s for `@HB` and each `@HD:`, 15 s for `@HO:`, and
  its 5 s default for `@HE`; `@HD:` is the only command in the app sent
  with `maxTries=1` (no retry — a repeated window would corrupt the
  image).
* The app fetches the image as a ZIP from
  `https://digitalassets.jura.com/mobileapp/JOE/…` and splits it into
  the `.dat` / `.bin` pair. **`jura-connect` never downloads firmware**;
  the caller supplies both blobs.

#### Milk-cooler status (`@HU?`)

The three hex digits are a state nibble plus a progress byte
(`MilkCoolerUpdateStatusParser`):

| Digits | State | Meaning |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| `0<xx>` | `idle` | not running; `xx` ≥ `0x64` (100) means "finished" |
| `1<xx>` | `updating` | in progress, `xx` is the percentage (hex) |
| `8<xx>` | `no_cooler` | no milk cooler connected — **this is the `@hu:800` the S8 EB answers**, re-confirmed live 2026-08-16 ([capture §5](captures/2026-08-16-kaffeebert-s8eb.md)) |
| other | `unknown` | firmware states we have no mapping for |

This settles §9's old "`@HU?` returned `@hu:800` in some probes but
`@TF:<hex>` in others": `@hu:800` *is* the answer to `@HU?` — "no milk
cooler attached" — and the `@TF:` frame the client keys on is just the
next unsolicited status broadcast arriving on the same socket. `@HU?`
therefore doubles as a harmless nudge for firmwares that need traffic
before they push a status frame.

J.O.E.'s update loop (`h8.a`): send `@HU`; on `wait` / `busy` poll
`@HU?` every 500 ms; a cooler that reports the `idle` state without
having reached 100 % gets another `@HU`; `abort` / `error` /
`no_cooler` stop the run.

#### What this library exposes, and what it deliberately does not

`jura_connect/firmware.py` implements the whole protocol layer: the
wire builders, the `@HB → @HO: → @HD:… → @HE` sequencer with progress
callbacks, the restart, and the milk-cooler start/status/poll loop.
Every mutating entry point is keyword-gated on
`acknowledge_bricking_risk=True` and raises `FirmwareSafetyError`
*before* touching the socket without it.

The **named-command registry only gains three entries**:

| Command | Wire | Gate |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| `milk-cooler-status` | `@HU?` | none (read-only) |
| `milk-cooler-update` | `@HU` | destructive |
| `restart-dongle` | `@HT:3` | destructive |

The OTA sequence itself is **library-only and has no CLI command** on
purpose:

* a named command can only ever perform *one* step, and a partially
  transferred image is precisely the failure mode that bricks the
  dongle — the sequence is only safe as an atomic operation;
* there is no image we can obtain or validate. Jura ships signed blobs
  from its CDN; this library has no network dependency, no signature
  check and no version check, so a CLI flag would amount to "point this
  at any file and hope";
* the recovery path for a failure is physical service, which is not a
  proportionate risk for a convenience wrapper.

Callers who genuinely need it can reach `JuraClient.run_firmware_ota()`
from Python, where supplying the two blobs and the acknowledgement flag
is an explicit act.

#### Destructive-prefix bookkeeping

`@HB`, `@HO:`, `@HD:`, `@HE` and `@HT:` are byte prefixes in
`commands.DESTRUCTIVE_PREFIXES`, so the `raw` escape hatch gates them
too. `@HU` **cannot** be a prefix: it would swallow the read-only
`@HU?`. It lives in `commands.DESTRUCTIVE_EXACT` instead, and
`commands.match_destructive()` is the single matcher the runtime gate,
the `raw` inspector and the simulator all share.

`JuraClient.close()` does **not** send `@HE`. Earlier releases did,
as a "polite close", which predated the discovery that `@HE` is the OTA
end marker; it looked harmless only because a dongle outside an OTA
session answers `@he:error`. `close()` now sends the empty frame
J.O.E.'s `WifiCommandCloseConnection` sends (§5.1), which is why `@HE`
can be gated here without breaking session teardown.

The simulator models the whole family — including `@hb:abort`,
`@ho:error`, `@hd:error` at a chosen chunk, `@he:error` and the
`busy` / `wait` / `abort` milk-cooler tokens — only when
`SimulatorConfig.firmware_enabled=True`. By default it answers
`@an:error` to every verb of the family, so a test that stumbles into
the sequence fails loudly.

---

## 6. Machine variants (`MachineProfile`)

The 89 machine XML files extracted from the J.O.E. APK
(`assets/documents/xml/<EF_code>/<version>.xml`) are vendored under
`jura_connect/data/xml/` and loaded on demand by
`jura_connect.profile.load_profile(code)`. They provide:

* the **alert bitmap** — bit index → name → severity
  (`block`/`info`/`ip` in the XML, mapped to `error`/`info`/`process`
  in Python);
* the **product code → name** map for the brew-counter table;
* (where present) the `<PROGRAMMODE>` section, currently exposed only
  as the kind-count vector consumed by `@TM:50`.

### 6.1 EF code lookup

`jura_connect/data/JOE_MACHINES.TXT` (vendored verbatim from the APK)
is a `;`-separated table of
``<article_number>;<friendly_name>;<EF_code>;<type>`` rows. Example
rows around the S8 EB:

```
15480;S8 (EB);EF1091;tt237w
15533;S8 (EB);EF1151;tt237w
```

The CLI's pair flow reads the article number from a UDP discovery
reply (offset 68..70, BE u16) and looks the EF code up in this table.
On firmwares that don't answer unicast UDP (notably TT237W) the
lookup fails — pass `--machine-type EF1091` explicitly, or retro-fit
later with ``jura-connect set-machine-type --name … EF1091``.

`jura_connect.profile.iter_profiles()` parses every bundled XML once
and caches the result via `lru_cache`. Loading a single profile is
roughly an `ElementTree.parse` + a couple of `findall(".//{*}TAG")`
sweeps — wildcard namespace traversal is used because each XML
declares the same `xmlns="http://www.top-tronic.com"` default
namespace.

### 6.2 EF536 fallback

Credentials without a `machine_type` field fall through to the
synthetic ``EF536`` baseline (the only profile the codebase hard-coded
before v0.8.0). The fallback covers the alert names and the
common product codes for the S8 / ENA8 / Z8 lineage; it doesn't know
about the S8 EB's `cortado` (`0x2B`) and friends. That's why
EF1091-paired machines should explicitly carry `machine_type = EF1091`
in their credential.

---

## 7. Credential persistence

### 7.1 File location

Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jura-connect/credentials.json`
(fall-back `~/.local/share/jura-connect/credentials.json`).

Override with the global CLI flag `--store /path/to.json` or the
`CredentialStore(path=...)` constructor argument.

### 7.2 On-disk format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "machines": {
    "Kaffeebert": {
      "address": "192.168.1.42",
      "conn_id": "jura-connect-7f31a8c2",
      "auth_hash": "13908FE4D3EB986B2465ACDB50398D4C1622836A5A1632257FF065C13156C052",
      "pin": "1234",
      "machine_type": "EF1091",
      "paired_at": "2026-05-11T08:42:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

`pin` is optional — present only for machines that require a setup PIN
on every reconnect (see §4.4). It is stored verbatim so reconnects
replay it, but `creds --json` redacts it to `pin_stored: true`.

`machine_type` is optional — omitted entries silently fall through to
the EF536 baseline. `CredentialStore.set_machine_type(name, code)`
retro-fits the field onto an existing entry without forcing a re-pair.

Writes go through a `mkstemp(dir=…)` + `os.replace` rename, so
mid-write power loss leaves the previous file intact. The file is
`chmod 0600`'d on write since the hash grants full control over the
machine.

### 7.3 End-to-end workflow

## 9. Known unknowns / next steps

* `@TG:7E` means "skip a quality-assistant step" in the APK but zeroed
  the maintenance counters on a TT237W S8 EB. Whether that is a
  firmware difference or a side effect of the skip is unresolved, and
  **must not** be resolved by probing hardware — the counters cannot be
  restored. See §5.8.
* Locked-screen behaviour: `@TS:01` followed by `@TS:00` works
  cleanly, but issuing `@TS:01` and then disconnecting leaves the
  display locked until power cycle.
* `@TM:42` returning data on a machine that *does* expose programmable
  slots has still not been observed live — the S8 EB / EF1091 reports
  a slot count via `@TM:50` but answers `@tm:C2` for every index. The
  configured-slot decode path is now **covered by simulation** (the
  simulator serves populated slots with real checksums, and
  `tests/test_pmode.py` round-trips a slot write through it), but it
  remains unobserved on hardware. Same for the `@TM:41` / `@TM:42`
  **writes** in §5.6.3 / §5.6.4: APK-derived, simulator-verified,
  never sent to a machine. A machine whose XML carries
  `Productprogramming="true"` (20 of the 89 bundled profiles, e.g.
  EF1143 / EF529) is what's needed to confirm them.
* `@TV:` decoding (§5.10): the **coffee path is settled**. The
  2026-08-16 brew capture pinned the 16-byte frame length, the window
  origin, the percentage at slot 12 (not 11), states `39`/`3C`/`41`/`3E`
  and the `BYPASS_WATER_VOLUME` branch of `41`. Still wanted from
  hardware: a **milk drink** (states `31`–`37`, `42`, `43` — the whole
  milk half of the table is untouched), a `41` frame from a recipe with
  **no** bypass (the `0xFF` → `HOTWATER_VOLUME` branch, which turns out
  never to have been observed), a maintenance cycle's process frames, a
  coffee-timer or P-mode frame, and any **`8F` extended-window** frame —
  we have still never seen one, and nothing in the app says which
  machines emit it.
* **What is a bare `@TS`?** Ten seconds after the last `ENJOY` of the
  captured brew the machine pushed `@TS` — uppercase, no colon, no
  payload — 3 ms before the `@TF:` broadcast resumed. Nothing had been
  sent; the watcher only ever issued the handshake. J.O.E. cannot
  explain it: `TCPReceiveHandler` routes `@hu:`, `@TV:` and `@TF:` and
  drops everything else as "no parser matched", and neither `@TB` nor
  `@TS` appears anywhere in the decompiled app. Two readings fit — an
  end-of-product bookend for `@TB`, or a "the panel is free again"
  notification matching the `@TS:` key-block verb (`@TS:01` has always
  been recorded as answering `@TB` **then** `@ts`, so `@TB` is not
  brew-specific either). Cheap experiment: lock and unlock an idle
  machine with `@TS:01` / `@TS:00` and watch for an unsolicited `@TS`.
  **What it means is still open, but the library no longer cares**: a
  bare `@TS` (like a bare `@TB`) is skipped as a marker wherever a reply
  is awaited and recorded in `status_history`, so the answer to the
  question can only add meaning, never fix a bug (§5.2).
* ~~**A pushed marker can be mistaken for a reply.**~~ **Fixed.** `@TB`
  and `@TS` are uppercase and payloadless, and `JuraClient.request()`
  without a `match` pattern used to return the first frame that was not
  `@TF:`/`@TV:` — so a marker arriving between a command and its answer
  was returned as the answer. `brew()` was the live exposure: it sent
  `@TP:` with no matcher and then classified the result with
  `_is_brew_accept`, so a marker could invert "did the machine accept my
  brew" and drive the `retry` / `follow` branches off it.
  `lock_screen` / `unlock_screen` were safe only by accident of case
  (they match the lowercase `^@ts`). Now: the matcher-less path skips
  markers (§5.2), `brew()` matches `BREW_REPLY_MATCH`, and
  `process.PROCESS_REPLY_MATCH` — an "anything that is not a push"
  pattern that *did* accept `@TB` — excludes them explicitly. Still
  unobserved on hardware: whether a remote `@TP:` start ever puts `@TB`
  ahead of its `@tp` ack. The client now survives either ordering, so
  the question is no longer load-bearing.
* **Window slots 8 and 11 held a constant `0x11`** through every frame
  of the captured brew (slot 8 is `max water temperature` in the app's
  table, slot 11 the unused `INTAKE_PERCENTAGE`). Neither 17 corresponds
  to anything in the recipe — the blob's temperature byte was `0x00`.
  Unexplained; harmless, since the decoder reads neither.
* **18 of EF1091's 83 `<STATE>` entries have no `ProgressState`
  counterpart** in the app's own enum (§5.11) — including `26` "Press
  Rinse", the state a cleaning cycle parks on. Either J.O.E. never
  renders those frames (it reads the XML for the label and the enum
  only for behaviour), or the machine never emits them. A capture of a
  real cleaning cycle settles it; until then `process.py` leans on the
  XML table and treats the enum as advisory.
* **The state *ordering* inside a maintenance cycle is a
  reconstruction** (§5.11). The XMLs declare which states exist and
  which need an `AcceptCommand`, never the sequence.
  `SimulatorConfig.process_sequences` is a plausible guess, so a
  `ProcessRunner` run is only as realistic as that guess.
* **`@TV:84` (§5.12): clock or label?** The frame carries the coffee
  timer's *target* time, hex-encoded per character, and J.O.E. sends it
  *after* the schedule rather than before — so it is not a prerequisite
  clock sync. Whether the machine sets its own clock from it or only
  renders "ready at 07:30" is unknown; nothing in the app reads a clock
  back. Related and equally open: whether `@TG:FF` cancels a *pending*
  timer or only a running brew.
* **The trailing 16-bit field on `@tt:0x` success replies** (§5.14). A
  successful `@TT:02` / `@TT:08` / `@TT:03` answers
  `@tt:0x,FF,<4 hex>`; the error codes carry no such field and J.O.E.
  never reads it. A running CRC over the selected block fits the
  evidence (`@TT:03` can fail with `FE = CRC_NOT_MATCHING`), but bytes
  remaining and next-expected-address are not ruled out. The library
  surfaces the field and interprets nothing.
* **The `@hd:` success body** (§5.15). J.O.E.'s matcher is
  `@hd:((error)|(.*))` — anything that is not the literal `error`
  counts as an ack — so what a real dongle puts there (an echoed
  offset? a chunk CRC? nothing at all?) is unrecorded. `firmware.py`
  follows the app and treats any non-`error` body as success, which
  means a body that *encodes* a failure would be missed. Not probeable
  without risking the dongle.
* **Does an `IntakeF18` machine require the 20-byte `@TP:` blob
  unconditionally?** (§5.13). J.O.E. always sends 20 bytes to such a
  machine; `jura-connect` keeps sending the live-verified 16-byte blob
  unless a preselection is requested. EF1091 has no manifest at all, so
  the maintainer's machine cannot answer this. If a preselection-free
  `@TP:` comes back `@tp:00` on an `IntakeF18` machine, the 20-byte
  form is the first thing to try.
* **The batch settings read `@TM:00,FC` (§5.7) still has a guessed
  reply layout — but the S8 EB rejects it outright.** Asked on
  2026-08-16, Kaffeebert answered `@tm:80` to both `@TM:00,FC` and the
  bare `@TM:00`, i.e. address `00` is not implemented at all. The
  question is no longer "what does the reply look like on an S8 EB" but
  "does *any* of the 57 declaring profiles actually implement the
  bank?" — the declaration looks like Jura boilerplate. Closing it
  needs a different machine; the read is harmless, so anyone with one
  can settle it in one command.
* **Does any machine implement `@TR:52` *and* declare it?** The S8 EB
  implements the special-counter bank and serves real values from it
  while its XML declares only `@TR:32` (§5.5). The design question
  ("trust the XML, or probe?") is **settled**: the default still trusts
  the XML, as J.O.E. does, and `probe=True` / `--probe` is the
  read-only opt-in that sends an undeclared bank anyway and tags the
  result `source="probed"` (§5.5, "The opt-in probe"). What is still
  open is whether any of the 14 declaring profiles is a machine that
  also implements it — and whether an *over*-declaring XML exists,
  which is the failure mode probing would fix and declaration-trust
  would not. Nobody has checked that direction.
* **The `@TR:52` slot→function map is still APK-derived.** Kaffeebert's
  four pages were captured raw (§5.5): its non-empty slots are 2 (=1),
  3 (=14) and 8 (=0x0A65 = 2661), and slot 0 — the bank's own total —
  sits at the `0xFFFF` unused sentinel. `--probe` now makes the live
  decode reachable, but nobody has checked the names it prints against
  what the machine has really poured. The APK map claims slot 3 is
  `sweetFoam` and slots 4+5+6 are `coldBrew`, and it has **no name at
  all for slot 8** — the largest count on the machine. So the map
  remains a reading of the APK, not a fact about this firmware.
* **`register-read <bank>` cannot work as specified.** A bare
  `@TR:<bank>` with no page argument draws no reply at all on TT237W
  (verified for banks `32` and `52`), so the command blocks for its
  full timeout and then raises. Either it should take a page argument
  or it should be dropped in favour of `raw '@TR:<bank>,<page>'`.
* **`cancel` (`@TG:FF`) has still never been sent to a machine.**
  During the 2026-08-16 run it was skipped because `AGENTS.md` §2
  listed `@TG:FF` as destructive while the code classed it as an
  ungated read. That contradiction is now resolved — `@TG:FF` is
  J.O.E.'s `WifiCommandCancelProductStep` and `AGENTS.md` no longer
  lists it — but the command itself remains unexercised, so its
  behaviour on an idle machine is still unknown (as is the related
  §5.12 question of whether it cancels a *pending* timer).
